We can pair the numbers in such a way that each pair consists of one positive and one negative number, which are consecutive even numbers. For example, (54 + 52) - 50, (48 + 46) - 44, and so on. Each pair sums to 2 more than the subtracted number. We can then count the number of pairs and multiply by 2 to find the total sum.\n\nLet's write a Python function to calculate this:\n\n```python\ndef solution():\n    \"\"\"Calculate the sum of the series: 54+52-50+48-46+...+4-2\"\"\"\n    # Start and end values of the series\n    start = 54\n    end = 2\n    \n    # Since the series alternates between addition and subtraction,\n    # and starts with addition, we can calculate the number of pairs\n    # by dividing the range by 4 (since each pair is separated by 4)\n    num_pairs = (start - end) // 4 + 1\n    \n    # Each pair contributes a value of 2 to the sum\n    result = num_pairs * 2\n    return result\n\n# Call the function and print the result\nprint(solution())\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the sum of the given series by finding the number of pairs and multiplying by 2, which is the net contribution of each pair to the sum."]}

For example, $(\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{50})$ is the negative of $(\\frac{1}{50} - \\frac{1}{2})$. This means that each pair of terms will multiply to -1.

The first term, a_1, is 5, and the common difference, d, is 4. We need to find the last term, which is 85, and then use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:\n\nThe sum of an arithmetic series can be calculated using the formula:\n$$ S_n = \\frac{n}{2} \\times (a_1 + a_n) $$\n\nwhere:\n- \\( S_n \\) is the sum of the first n terms,\n- \\( n \\) is the number of terms,\n- \\( a_1 \\) is the first term, and\n- \\( a_n \\) is the last term.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of terms, \\( n \\). Since the sequence starts at 5 and ends at 85 with a common difference of 4, we can find \\( n \\) by rearranging the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence:\n$$ a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d $$\n\nSolving for \\( n \\):\n$$ n = \\frac{a_n - a_1}{d} + 1 $$\n\nLet's calculate this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef solution():\n    \"\"\"Calculate the sum of the arithmetic sequence 5+9+13+17+...+85.\"\"\"\n    a_1 = 5\n    a_n = 85\n    d = 4\n    n = (a_n - a_1) // d + 1  # Use integer division since n must be an integer\n    S_n = n * (a_1 + a_n) // 2  # Again use integer division for an integer result\n    return S_n\n```\n\nThis function will calculate the sum of the arithmetic sequence from 5 to 85 with a common difference of 4."]}
