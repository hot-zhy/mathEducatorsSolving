The notation `ab` represents a two-digit number with `a` as the tens digit and `b` as the ones digit, not the product of `a` and `b`. Similarly, `ba` represents the two-digit number with `b` as the tens digit and `a` as the ones digit.

Pip\\textquotesingle s number and Bud\\textquotesingle s number add up to $5510$. What is Pip\\textquotesingle s number? ", "knowledge_point_routes": ["Overseas Competition->Knowledge Point->Combinatorics->Number Puzzles"], "answer": "None", "generation": ["**Step 1: Formulate Equations:**\n\nLet's denote the four-digit number that Pip writes down as `ABCD`, where `A`, `B`, `C`, and `D` are the thousands, hundreds, tens, and units digits, respectively. According to the problem, the thousands digit is the same as the units digit, so `A = D`.\n\nBud reverses the units and tens digits to get a new number, which we can denote as `ABDC`.\n\nThe sum of Pip's number and Bud's number is given as 5510. We can express this as an equation:\n\n`1000A + 100B + 10C + D + 1000A + 100B + 10D + C = 5510`\n\nSince `A = D`, we can simplify this equation to:\n\n`2000A + 200B + 20C + 2A = 5510`\n\nNow, we can simplify further by dividing the entire equation by 2:\n\n`1000A + 100B + 10C + A = 2755`\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\n`1001A + 100B + 10C = 2755`\n\nNow we have one equation with three unknowns, which is not enough to solve for the values of `A`, `B`, and `C` directly. However, we know that `A`, `B`, and `C` must be digits, so they can only take values from 0 to 9. We can use this information to find a solution that satisfies the equation.\n\n**Step 2: Solve Equations Using Python Code:**\n\nWe will use a brute-force approach to try all possible combinations of `A`, `B`, and `C` to find the one that satisfies the equation.\n\n```python\ndef solution():\n    # Iterate over possible values of A, B, and C\n    for A in range(10):\n        for B in range(10):\n            for C in range(10):\n                # Check if the current combination satisfies the equation\n                if 1001 * A + 100 * B + 10 * C == 2755:\n                    # Construct Pip's number using the digits A, B, C, and A (since D = A)\n                    result = 1000 * A + 100 * B + 10 * C + A\n                    return result\n\n# Call the function and print the result\nprint(solution())\n```\n\nThis code will iterate through all possible values of `A`, `B`, and `C` (from 0 to 9) and check if they satisfy the given equation. Once it finds the correct combination, it constructs Pip's number and returns it."]}
