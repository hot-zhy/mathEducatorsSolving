The difference in the number of boys and girls is 55, which is the sum of the differences of each layer.\n11. We need to find the value of n that satisfies this condition.\n\nLet's calculate the difference between boys and girls for each layer until we reach a difference of 55. We will start with n=3 (the smallest odd number for which there can be layers) and increase n by 2 each time (to maintain an odd number of layers).\n\n```python\ndifference = 55\nn = 3  # Starting with the smallest odd number for layers\n\nwhile True:\n    boys = sum([(n - 2*i)**2 - (n - 2*(i+1))**2 for i in range(0, n//2)])\n    girls = sum([(n - 2*(i+1))**2 - (n - 2*(i+2))**2 for i in range(0, (n-1)//2)])\n    if boys - girls == difference:\n        break\n    n += 2  # Increase n by 2 to maintain an odd number of layers\n\ntotal_students = n**2\n```\n\n12. The value of n that satisfies the condition will give us the total number of students, which is n^2.\n\nAnswer: The Python code will provide the total number of students. @"]}
