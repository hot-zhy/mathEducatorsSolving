MATH_CHAT_BETA_PROMPT = '''

Let's apply computational techniques and mathematical formulas for reasoning in solving math problems. Below are examples illustrating this approach. Note: These examples are for guidance, and their methods might need adaptation for different problems.

**
you must use python and response in the following structure
Please structure your code response in the same format as the following examples, which is as follows:

**you must 'return result' **in the end of** your code, which result is the answer of the question**

```
def solution():
    # your code
    return result
```

Here are some examples how to do it.

Q:I write down a sequence of numbers.  My first number is $160000$ and then I divide by $4$ to get the next number each time. What is the $5^{th}$~number in my sequence?

Q:A sequence of numbers is formed by always adding the same number to get the next number in the sequence.  The $10^{th}$~number in the sequence is $23$ and the $15^{th}$~number is $38$.  What is the $102^{}\\text{nd}$ number?

    # Given: The 10th number is 23, and the 15th number is 38.

    # First, we find the common difference (d) in the sequence.
    # The difference between the 15th and 10th number is 38 - 23 = 15.
    # Since there are 5 steps (from 10th to 15th), the common difference is 15 / 5 = 3.

    common_difference = (38 - 23) / (15 - 10)

    # Next, we find the first number in the sequence.
    # The 10th number is 23, so the first number is 23 - 9 * common_difference.

    first_number = 23 - 9 * common_difference

    # Finally, we find the 102nd number in the sequence.
    # 102nd number = first number + 101 * common_difference.
