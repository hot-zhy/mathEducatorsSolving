Question: $$36$$ is a square number because it can be written $$6\\times6$$.  Similarly, $$64=8\\times8$$ is a square number.  $$1000$$ is a cube number because it can be written $$10\\times10\\times10$$  Similarly, $$343=7\\times7\\times7$$ is a cube number.  The French mathematician Pierre de Fermat claimed correctly that there is only one square number that is $$2$$ less than a cube number.  It is less than $$50$$.  What is it?  ANSWER~\\uline{~~~~~~~~~~}~，
```
def solution():
    # Fermat's claim is about finding a square number that is 2 less than a cube number, and it is less than 50.
    # This means we need to find a number 'n' such that n^3 - 2 is a square number, and n^3 < 50.

    # We will iterate over possible cube numbers less than 50 and check if n^3 - 2 is a square number.
    for n in range(1, int(50 ** (1/3)) + 1):  # Cube root of 50 is approximately 3.684, so we check up to 4
        cube = n ** 3
        if cube < 50:
            square_candidate = cube - 2
            # Check if square_candidate is a perfect square
            if int(square_candidate ** 0.5) ** 2 == square_candidate:
                result = square_candidate
                break

    return result

Question:$$\\overline{ABCD}$$ represents a $$4$$-digit number, and $$\\overline{EFG}$$~ represents a $$3$$-digit number. $$A-G$$ each represents a different number from $$1$$ to $$9$$. Given that the sum of these two numbers is $$1993$$, find the difference between the largest possible product and the least possible product of these two numbers. 
```
def solution():
    # Define the sum of the two numbers
    total_sum = 1993
    
    # For the largest product, we want the 4-digit number to be as large as possible and the 3-digit number as small as possible
    # The smallest 3-digit number is 100, so the largest 4-digit number would be 1993 - 100 = 1893
    max_4_digit = 1893
    min_3_digit = 100

    # For the smallest product, we want the 4-digit number to be as small as possible and the 3-digit number as large as possible
    # The largest 3-digit number is 999, so the smallest 4-digit number would be 1993 - 999 = 994
    min_4_digit = 994
    max_3_digit = 999

    # Calculate the products
    largest_product = max_4_digit * min_3_digit
    smallest_product = min_4_digit * max_3_digit

    # Calculate the difference between the largest and smallest products
    difference = largest_product - smallest_product
    result=difference
    return result

Question:I am a number with $$3$$ decimal places.  The digit $$9$$ is in the thousandths place.  The digit $$7$$ is in the hundredths place.  The digit $$6$$ is in the tenths place.  The ones place has a value of $$4$$.  Round off this number to one decimal place.  What number am I?~\\uline{~~~~~~~~~~}~     Tongtong says, \\"I think the answer to the above is $$9764.0$$.\\"  Is she correct? If not, state the correct answer. 
```
def solution():
    # Construct the number based on the provided information
    number = 4.679

    # Rounding the number to one decimal place
    rounded_number = round(number, 1)
    result = rounded_number

Question:（AMC 2020 Question \\#26）  Janine thinks of three numbers.  Between them, they use the digits 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9, with each digit being used exactly once.  The second number is 2 times the first number.  The third number is 4 times the first number.  What is the third number? 
```
def solution():
    # The problem is to find three numbers using the digits 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 exactly once.
    # The second number is twice the first, and the third is four times the first.
    # We will use permutations from itertools to try all possible combinations of these digits.

    from itertools import permutations

    # Generate all permutations of the digits
    digits = [1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
    for perm in permutations(digits):
        # Divide the permutation into three numbers
        first_number = perm[0] * 100 + perm[1] * 10 + perm[2]
        second_number = perm[3] * 100 + perm[4] * 10 + perm[5]
        third_number = perm[6] * 1000

        # Check if the conditions are met
        if second_number == 2 * first_number and third_number == 4 * first_number:
			result = third_number
            return result
```

Question:What is the ones digit of $$2^{17}$$? 
```
def solution():
    # The problem is to find the ones digit of 2^17.
    # The ones digit of powers of 2 follows a repeating pattern: 2, 4, 8, 6.

    # Finding the position of the ones digit in the repeating pattern for 2^17
    # Since the pattern repeats every 4 numbers, we use modulo 4
    pattern_position = 17 % 4

    # The repeating pattern for the ones digit of powers of 2
    pattern = [2, 4, 8, 6]

    # Finding the ones digit
    ones_digit = pattern[pattern_position - 1]  # Subtract 1 because list indexing starts at 0
    result = ones_digit
    return result
```

Question:A number has a digit sum of $20$. The number is divisible by $11$. What is the smallest possible value of the number?
```
def solution():
    # The problem is to find the smallest possible number with a digit sum of 20 that is also divisible by 11.
    # A number is divisible by 11 if the difference between the sum of the digits at odd positions and the sum of the digits at even positions is either 0 or a multiple of 11.
    # We start with the smallest possible number with a digit sum of 20 and check for divisibility by 11.
    # If it's not divisible, we increment to the next number with a digit sum of 20 and repeat the process.

    # Function to calculate the sum of digits of a number
    def sum_of_digits(number):
        return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(number))

    # Function to check divisibility by 11
    def is_divisible_by_11(number):
        odd_sum = 0
        even_sum = 0
        for i, digit in enumerate(str(number)):
            if i % 2 == 0:
                odd_sum += int(digit)
            else:
                even_sum += int(digit)
        return (odd_sum - even_sum) % 11 == 0

    # Starting with the smallest number with a digit sum of 20
    number = 29  # Smallest two-digit number with sum of digits as 20

    while True:
        if sum_of_digits(number) == 20 and is_divisible_by_11(number):
			result = number
            return result
        number += 1
```

Question:Think of a number  Add $3$  Multiply by $2$  Take away $2$  Add $10$  Divide by $2$  Take away the number you started with  Write down the number that is left?
```
def solution():
    # The problem is a sequence of arithmetic operations starting with an unknown number x.
    # The sequence of operations is: Add 3, Multiply by 2, Take away 2, Add 10, Divide by 2, and Take away x.
    # Following these steps, the final expression is x + 7 - x.

    # Simplifying the final expression
    result = 7  # Since x + 7 - x simplifies to 7

    return result
