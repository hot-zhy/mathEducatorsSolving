Q: There are 9 different potted plants in a garden. How many ways can 4 potted plants be arranged in a row?

```
def solution():
    # The problem is to find the number of ways to arrange 4 out of 9 different potted plants in a row.
    # This is a permutation problem, which can be solved using the permutation formula P(n, k) = n! / (n - k)!
    # where n is the total number of items and k is the number of items to arrange.

    import math

    # Total number of potted plants
    n = 9

    # Number of potted plants to arrange
    k = 4

    # Calculate the number of ways using the permutation formula
    result = math.factorial(n) / math.factorial(n - k)

    return result
```


Q: Five students A, B, C, D, and E line up in a row. If A wants to stand in the middle of B and C (not necessarily next to each other) how many ways are there to arrange them?

```
def solution():
    import math
    # Calculating the number of ways based on the provided logic

    # A in position 2 or 4: 2 options for B and C's position and 3! ways for the other three spots
    a_pos_2_4 = 2 * math.factorial(3)

    # A in position 3: 2 options for B and C's position either side of A, and 2 possibilities for each of the 4 spots
    a_pos_3 = 2 * 2 * 2 * 2

    # Total number of ways
    result = a_pos_2_4 + a_pos_3 + a_pos_2_4

    return result
```


Q: The spring sports meeting is coming soon, and every student in Class 1 of Grade 6 has signed up for at least one event. If there are 40 students participating in skipping rope and 31 students participating in long jump, and 21 students participating in both events, how many students are participating in only one event?

```
def solution():
    # The problem is to find the number of students participating in **only** one event.
    # This can be solved using the principle of Inclusion-Exclusion.
    #we should adjust this formula to: Only one event=∣A∣+∣B∣−2×∣A∩B∣
    # Total students participating in only one event = 
    # Students in Skipping Rope + Students in Long Jump - 2 * Students in Both

    # Number of students participating in skipping rope
    skipping_rope = 40

    # Number of students participating in long jump
    long_jump = 31

    # Number of students participating in both
    both = 21

    # Calculate the number of students participating in only one event
    result = skipping_rope + long_jump - 2 * both

    return result

Q: A palindromic number is the same when written backwards as forwards, e.g., 454 is a palindromic number. How many three-digit palindromic numbers are there in total?
```
def solution():
    # A three-digit palindromic number is of the form 'aba', where 'a' and 'b' are digits.
    # 'a' can be any digit from 1 to 9 (since it cannot be 0 for a three-digit number),
    # and 'b' can be any digit from 0 to 9.
    # Therefore, the total number of three-digit palindromic numbers is the product
    # of the number of choices for 'a' and the number of choices for 'b'.

    choices_for_a = 9  # (Digits from 1 to 9)
    choices_for_b = 10  # (Digits from 0 to 9)

    # The total number of three-digit palindromic numbers
    result = choices_for_a * choices_for_b

    return result
```

Q: How many different ways are there to divide 13 oranges to 3 kids, to make sure each of them gets at least two oranges?
```
def solution():
    import math

    # Total number of oranges
    total_oranges = 13

    # Minimum number of oranges each kid must receive
    min_oranges_per_kid = 2

    # Number of kids
    kids = 3

    # Adjust total oranges by subtracting the minimum guaranteed oranges per kid
    adjusted_total_oranges = total_oranges - (min_oranges_per_kid * kids)

    # Number of partitions (bars) needed is one less than the number of kids
    partitions = kids - 1

    # Calculate combinations using factorial
    result = math.factorial(adjusted_total_oranges + partitions) / (math.factorial(partitions) * math.factorial(adjusted_total_oranges))

    return result
```

Q: How many different ways are there to divide 20 pens to 6 kids, to make sure each of them gets at least one pen?
```
def solution():
    import math

    # Total number of pens
    total_pens = 20

    # Minimum number of pens each kid must receive
    min_pens_per_kid = 1

    # Number of kids
    kids = 6

    # Adjust total pens by subtracting the minimum guaranteed pens per kid
    adjusted_total_pens = total_pens - (min_pens_per_kid * kids)

    # Number of partitions (bars) needed is one less than the number of kids
    partitions = kids - 1

    # Calculate combinations using factorial
    result = math.factorial(adjusted_total_pens + partitions) / (math.factorial(partitions) * math.factorial(adjusted_total_pens))

    return result
```

Q:I have five children and want to place them in a line for a photograph. However, Hugh refuses to stand anywhere in between Louise and Richard. How many ways are there to place the children in a line and still keep Hugh happy?

```
def solution():
    import math

    # Total number of children
    n = 5

    # Total permutations without any restrictions
    total_permutations = math.factorial(n)

    # Calculating the permutations where Hugh is between Louise and Richard
    # Treat Hugh, Louise, and Richard as one unit when Hugh is between them.
    # There are 2 arrangements for Louise and Richard around Hugh.
    # The unit along with the other two children can be arranged in 4! ways.
    restricted_permutations = math.factorial(4) * 2

    # The number of valid arrangements is the total permutations minus the restricted ones
    result = total_permutations - restricted_permutations

    return result

```


Q:How many different ways are there to divide 19 books to 4 kids, to make sure each of them gets at least one book?
```
def solution():
    # The problem is to find the number of ways to divide 19 books among 4 kids, ensuring each kid gets at least one book.
    # This is a problem of distributing n identical items (books) into k distinct groups (kids) with each group getting at least one item.
    # The solution can be found using the "stars and bars" theorem (a combinatorial method).
    # The number of ways to do this is given by C(n - 1, k - 1), where C is the binomial coefficient.

    import math

    # Total number of books
    n = 19

    # Total number of kids
    k = 4

    # Calculate the number of ways using the binomial coefficient
    # We subtract 1 from n and k to account for the condition that each kid must get at least one book
    result = math.comb(n - 1, k - 1)

    return result
```


Q:There are four entrances to a high-speed rail station. Joe, Mike, and Tina are going to enter the station to take the high-speed rail. Joe and Mike cannot join the same entrance. The order in which the three people enter the station is uncertain. How many different ways are there for them to enter the station?
```
def solution():
    # The problem is to find the number of ways Joe, Mike, and Tina can enter a high-speed rail station with four entrances,
    # given that Joe and Mike cannot use the same entrance.

    # There are 4 choices for Joe.
    # After Joe chooses an entrance, there are 3 choices left for Mike (since he can't use the same entrance as Joe).
    # After Joe and Mike have chosen their entrances, Tina has 2 choices left (since 2 entrances are already taken).

    # The total number of ways they can enter the station is the product of these choices.

    # Number of choices for Joe
    choices_for_joe = 4

    # Number of choices for Mike
    choices_for_mike = 3

    # Number of choices for Tina
    choices_for_tina = 2

    # Calculate the total number of ways
    result = choices_for_joe * choices_for_mike * choices_for_tina

    return result
```


Q:In any permutation of 1, 2, 3, ... , 7, 8, how many permutations are there such that any two adjacent numbers are coprime?
```
def solution():
    from itertools import permutations
    from math import gcd

    # Define the range of numbers
    numbers = range(1, 9)

    # Check if two adjacent numbers in a permutation are coprime
    def is_coprime_perm(perm):
        for i in range(len(perm) - 1):
            if gcd(perm[i], perm[i + 1]) != 1:
                return False
        return True

    # Generate all permutations of the given numbers
    perms = permutations(numbers)

    # Count permutations where all adjacent numbers are coprime
    result = sum(1 for perm in perms if is_coprime_perm(perm))

    return result

```

Q:There are 6 people sitting around an eight-seater circular table. How many different orders are there for them to sit? (If we can get the same order after rotating the table, then we regard the two orders as the same one.)
```
def solution():
    # The problem is to find the number of different orders for 6 people sitting around an eight-seater circular table.
    # In circular permutations, the formula to use is (n - 1)! for n objects, since rotating the objects doesn't count as a new arrangement.
    # However, since there are only 6 people for an 8-seat table, we need to first choose 6 seats out of 8, and then arrange the 6 people.
    # The number of ways to choose 6 seats from 8 is a combination problem: C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!)
    # After choosing the seats, we arrange the 6 people in a circular arrangement.

    import math

    # Total number of seats
    total_seats = 8

    # Number of people
    people = 6

    # Calculate the number of ways to choose 6 seats from 8
    seat_choices = math.factorial(total_seats) / (math.factorial(people) * math.factorial(total_seats - people))

    # Calculate the number of ways to arrange 6 people in a circular manner
    circular_arrangements = math.factorial(people - 1)

    # The total number of different orders is the product of seat choices and circular arrangements
    result = seat_choices * circular_arrangements

    return result
```


Q:AMC 2018 Question #28） I wrote the counting numbers joined together: 1234567891011121314151617... Which of the counting numbers was I writing when the 100th zero was written?
```
def solution():
    # The task is to find the number at which the 100th zero is written
    # when counting numbers are written in sequence: 123456789101112131415...

    # Initialize variables
    current_number = 1  # Start with number 1
    zero_count = 0  # Counter for zeros

    # Loop until the 100th zero is reached
    while zero_count < 100:
        # Convert current number to string to check for zeros
        current_str = str(current_number)

        # Count the zeros in the current number
        zero_count += current_str.count('0')

        # If the 100th zero is reached or passed, break the loop
        if zero_count >= 100:
            break
