We are also told that there are 190 more women than children, so the number of women is C + 190.\n\nThe problem states that 2/5 of the people were women. This means that the total number of people at the exhibition is 5/2 times the number of women, which can be expressed as:\nTotal number of people = (5/2) * (C + 190)\n\nWe also know that the total number of people is the sum of the number of women, men, and children:\nTotal number of people = (C + 190) + 3C + C\n\nNow we can set up an equation to solve for C:\n(5/2) * (C + 190) = (C + 190) + 3C + C\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:\n5 * (C + 190) = 2 * ((C + 190) + 3C + C)\n\nExpanding both sides:\n5C + 950 = 2C + 380 + 6C + 2C\n\nCombining like terms:\n5C + 950 = 10C + 380\n\nSubtracting 5C from both sides:\n950 = 5C + 380\n\nSubtracting 380 from both sides:\n570 = 5C\n\nDividing by 5:\nC = 114\n\nNow we can find the total number of people by substituting C back into the equation for the total number of people:\nTotal number of people = (5/2) * (C + 190)\nTotal number of people = (5/2) * (114 + 190)\nTotal number of people = (5/2) * 304\nTotal number of people = 5 * 152\nTotal number of people = 760\n\nAnswer: 760."]}
