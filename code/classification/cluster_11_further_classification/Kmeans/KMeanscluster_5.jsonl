The total job can be represented by a certain number of pages, let's call it \\( J \\).\n\nFrom the first scenario, we have:\n\\( 5S + 20N = J \\) (1)\n\nFrom the second scenario, we have:\n\\( 20S + 8N = J \\) (2)\n\nWe have two equations with two unknowns. We can solve this system of equations to find the value of \\( N \\), which represents Nini's typing rate.\n\nFirst, let's multiply equation (1) by 4 to make the coefficient of \\( S \\) the same as in equation (2):\n\\( 4(5S + 20N) = 4J \\)\n\\( 20S + 80N = 4J \\) (3)\n\nNow, let's subtract equation (2) from equation (3):\n\\( (20S + 80N) - (20S + 8N) = 4J - J \\)\n\\( 72N = 3J \\)\n\nDividing both sides by 72 gives us Nini's typing rate:\n\\( N = \\frac{3J}{72} \\)\n\\( N = \\frac{J}{24} \\)\n\nNow we need to find how long it will take Nini to finish the job by herself. Since \\( N \\) is the rate at which Nini types and \\( J \\) is the total job, the time \\( T \\) it takes for Nini to finish the job by herself is:\n\\( T = \\frac{J}{N} \\)\n\nSubstituting \\( N \\) with \\( \\frac{J}{24} \\):\n\\( T = \\frac{J}{\\frac{J}{24}} \\)\n\\( T = 24 \\) hours\n\nAnswer: It will take Nini 24 hours to finish the job by herself."]}
