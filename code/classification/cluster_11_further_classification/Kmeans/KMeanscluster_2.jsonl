We are given two conditions:\n1. If A packed 8 cookies into each box, there would be no cookies left. This means that C is a multiple of 8.\n2. If A packed 9 cookies into each box, there would be 1 cookie left. This means that C, when divided by 9, gives a remainder of 1.\n\nWe can express these conditions using the following equations:\nC = 8k (for some integer k)\nC = 9m + 1 (for some integer m)\n\nWe need to find the smallest value of C that satisfies both conditions. This is equivalent to finding the least common multiple (LCM) of 8 and 9, and then adding 1 to it (since C must leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 9).\n\nSince 8 and 9 are coprime (they have no common factors other than 1), the LCM of 8 and 9 is simply their product: 8 * 9 = 72.\n\nTherefore, the least number of cookies A could have had, which is one more than a multiple of 72, is 72 + 1 = 73.\n\nAnswer: 73."]}

Since she bought twice as many apple tarts, she bought 2x apple tarts.\nLet the cost of one apple tart be y dollars. Therefore, the cost of one strawberry tart is y + $0.40.\n\nSince she spent an equal amount of money on each type of tart, we can write the equation:\nx(y + 0.40) = 2xy\n\nThe total amount she spent is $40, so we can write another equation:\nx(y + 0.40) + 2xy = 40\n\nNow we can solve these equations to find the values of x and y.\n\nFrom the first equation:\nxy + 0.40x = 2xy\n0.40x = xy\n0.40x = x * y\ny = 0.40\n\nSubstitute y = 0.40 into the second equation:\nx(0.40 + 0.40) + 2x(0.40) = 40\nx(0.80) + 0.80x = 40\n1.60x = 40\nx = 40 / 1.60\nx = 25\n\nSince x is the number of strawberry tarts, she bought 25 strawberry tarts and 2x apple tarts, which is 2 * 25 = 50 apple tarts.\n\nThe total number of tarts she bought is 25 (strawberry tarts) + 50 (apple tarts) = 75 tarts.\n\nAnswer: 75."]}
