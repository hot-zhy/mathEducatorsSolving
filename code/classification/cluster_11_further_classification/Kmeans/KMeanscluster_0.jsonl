Since Rina bought the handbag for $60 with a 20% discount, we can represent the original price as P.\n\nThe price after a 20% discount is 80% of the original price (100% - 20% = 80%). So we can write the equation:\n0.80 * P = $60\n\nNow we solve for P:\nP = $60 / 0.80\nP = $75\n\nNow we know the original price of the handbag is $75. Ana paid $67.50 for the handbag, so the discount she received can be calculated as follows:\nDiscount = Original Price - Price Paid by Ana\nDiscount = $75 - $67.50\nDiscount = $7.50\n\nTo find the percentage discount given to Ana, we use the formula:\nPercentage Discount = (Discount / Original Price) * 100%\n\nSubstituting the values we have:\nPercentage Discount = ($7.50 / $75) * 100%\nPercentage Discount = 0.10 * 100%\nPercentage Discount = 10%\n\nSo, the discount given to Ana was 10%.\n\nAnswer: 10%."]}
