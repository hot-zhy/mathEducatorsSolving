Question: $$36$$ is a square number because it can be written $$6\\times6$$.  Similarly, $$64=8\\times8$$ is a square number.  $$1000$$ is a cube number because it can be written $$10\\times10\\times10$$  Similarly, $$343=7\\times7\\times7$$ is a cube number.  The French mathematician Pierre de Fermat claimed correctly that there is only one square number that is $$2$$ less than a cube number.  It is less than $$50$$.  What is it?  ANSWER~\\uline{~~~~~~~~~~}~，

Process:
To find the square number that is 2 less than a cube number,we can list the following equation:x^2+2 = y^3, we can start by manually checking values of y staring from 2 to 50, and checking if x^2+2 is equal to y^3:
    2^3 = 8 (not a solution, no square number 2 less)
    3^3 = 27 (is a solution, 5^2 =25, 2 less than 27)
    4^3 = 64 (not a solution, no square number 2 less)
    5^3 = 125 (no square number less than 125, so not a solution)
We find that 3^3 = 27, and the nearest square number less than it is 5^2 = 25. Since 25 is 2 less than 27, it satisfies the condition.
Therefore, the square number that is 2 less than a cube number, and less than 50, is 5.
The answer is 5.

Answer:5

Question:$$\\overline{ABCD}$$ represents a $$4$$-digit number, and $$\\overline{EFG}$$~ represents a $$3$$-digit number. $$A-G$$ each represents a different number from $$1$$ to $$9$$. Given that the sum of these two numbers is $$1993$$, find the difference between the largest possible product and the least possible product of these two numbers. 

Process:
The sum of two numbers is fixed, and the smaller the difference between the two numbers, the larger the product. To maximize ABCDXEFG, the difference between ABCD and EFG should be minimized, where the minimum value of ABCD is 1234, then EFG1993-1234=759 without repeating numbers, so the maximum value of the product is :
    1234×759=936606
To minimize ABCDXEFG, the difference between ABCD and EFG should be maximum, where the minimum value of EFG is 234(because A=1) At this time EFG=1993-234=1759, there are no repeating numbers, so the minimum value of the product is:
    1759×234=411606
Hence, the difference between the two products is:
    936606 - 411606 = 525000
The answer is 525000

Answer:525000

Question:I am a number with $$3$$ decimal places.  The digit $$9$$ is in the thousandths place.  The digit $$7$$ is in the hundredths place.  The digit $$6$$ is in the tenths place.  The ones place has a value of $$4$$.  Round off this number to one decimal place.  What number am I?~\\uline{~~~~~~~~~~}~     Tongtong says, \\"I think the answer to the above is $$9764.0$$.\\"  Is she correct? If not, state the correct answer. 

Process:
To correctly determine whether Tongtong's answer is correct, we need to analyze the given information.According to the information provided, the number with 3 decimal places has the following digits:
    Thousandths place: 9
    Hundredths place: 7
    Tenths place: 6
    Ones place: 4
Combining these digits, the original number is 4.679.
Now, let's round off this number to one decimal place. We look at the digit immediately after the tenths place, which is the hundredths place.
Since the digit in the hundredths place is 7, which is greater than or equal to 5, we round up the tenths place. Therefore, the rounded value is 4.7.
To determine if Tongtong's answer is correct, we compare it with the rounded value. If the rounded value is the same as Tongtong's answer (9764.0), then she is correct. Otherwise, she is incorrect.
In this case, Tongtong's answer is not correct. The correct answer is 4.7, not 9764.0
The answer is 4.7

Answer: 4.7

Question:On a ferry, the total number of cars, bikes and lorries is an even number and is less than $$100$$. The number of cars is four-thirds of the number of bikes. The number of bikes is one quarter more than the number of lorries. How many cars, bikes and lorries are there on the ferry?

Process:
Let's assume the number of cars is represented by 'C', the number of bikes by 'B', and the number of lorries by 'L'.
According to the given conditions:
The total number of vehicles (C + B + L) is an even number.
The number of cars (C) is four-thirds of the number of bikes (B). Mathematically, this can be written as C = (4/3)B.
The number of bikes (B) is one quarter more than the number of lorries (L). Mathematically, this can be written as B = L + (1/4)L.
Now, let's solve the equations step by step:
Using equation 3, we can rewrite it as B = (5/4)L.
We'll substitute this value of B in equation 2: 
    C = (4/3)(5/4)L.
    C = (5/3)L.
We know that the total number of vehicles (C + B + L) is an even number and less than 100. So,
C + B + L = 2n (an even number, n could be any whole number) and C + B + L < 100.
Substituting the values of C and B in terms of L:
    (5/3)L + (5/4)L + L = 2n and (5/3)L + (5/4)L + L < 100.
Finding a common denominator and simplifying:
    (20/12)L + (15/12)L + (12/12)L = 2n and (20/12)L + (15/12)L + (12/12)L < 100.
    (47/12)L = 2n and (47/12)L < 100.
To find a whole number value for L, observing the equation (47/12)L = 2n, we can infer that L must be a multiple of 12 (denominator of L) to make the right-hand side an even number.
If we start with L = 12, then (47/12)L = (47/12)(12) = 47, which is an odd number. So, L must be a multiple of 12 greater than 12.
Trying L = 24, we get (47/12)L = (47/12)(24) = 94, which is an even number.
So, one possible solution is L = 24.
Plugging this value into the inequality, we get (47/12)(24) < 100. The left-hand side evaluates to 94, which is indeed less than 100.
Now, calculating the corresponding values for B and C:
    B = L + (1/4)L = 24 + (1/4)(24) = 24 + 6 = 30,
    C = (5/3)L = (5/3)(24) = 40.
Therefore, on the ferry, there are 40 cars, 30 bikes, and 24 lorries.
The answer is 24

Answer:24

Question:（AMC 2020 Question \\#26）  Janine thinks of three numbers.  Between them, they use the digits 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9, with each digit being used exactly once.  The second number is 2 times the first number.  The third number is 4 times the first number.  What is the third number? 

Process:
Since there are only two even numbers, 6 and 8, then they are the members of the second and third numbers, and the third number is twice the second number, so 8 is the units of the second number, and 6 is the units of the third number
Since each number is used exactly once, then the third number is 1_6. After trying to fill in 5 in the space, that is, the third number is 156, then the first number is 39 and the second number is 78.
The answer is 156 

Answer: 156
