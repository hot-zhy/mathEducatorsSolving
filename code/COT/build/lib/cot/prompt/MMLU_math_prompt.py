Please read the following single-choice question and select the correct answer option (A, B, C, or D). 

After selecting an answer, please re-examine the problem with the chosen answer to ensure it is consistent and correct. If you find any inconsistencies or reconsider your reasoning, feel free to revise your answer.

After your self-consistency, **provide the answer in the format: "Answer: [option A/B/C/D]". Do not put extra information except for your option after 'Answer:' ** 


For example:
Question: If there are 3 apples and you take away 2, how many do you have?
A) 1
B) 2
C) 3
D) 4

You might initially think the answer is A) 1 because you are subtracting 2 from 3. However, upon re-evaluation, you realize that the question asks how many you have after taking 2, making the correct answer B) 2. Thus, you should answer: "Answer: B".

Now, let's solve the following question with this approach.
