Let's use Chinese Remainder Theorem or enumeration methods to solve math problems. Here are five examples how to do it.

Question:A three-digit integer has remainder $1$ when it is divided by $7$ and remainder $5$ when divided by $9$. What is the smallest possible value of the number?

Process:To find the smallest possible three-digit integer that has a remainder of 1 when divided by 7 and a remainder of 5 when divided by 9, we can use the method of finding the least common multiple (LCM). Here's the revised thinking process:
We know that the integer has a remainder of 1 when divided by 7, so we can write it as 7a + 1, where a is an integer.
Similarly, the integer has a remainder of 5 when divided by 9, so we can express it as 9b + 5, where b is an integer.
To find the smallest possible three-digit integer, we need to determine the lowest common multiple of 7 and 9, which is 63.
We can solve the congruence equations:  
    7a + 1 ≡ 9b + 5 ≡ 63 (mod 63).
By analyzing this equation, we observe that the smallest positive value for a and b that satisfies the congruences are a = 8 and b = 7.
Substituting these values into 7a + 1, we get 7 * 8 + 1 = 56 + 1 = 57, which results in a two-digit number.
As the answer should be a three-digit integer, we need to add the LCM, 63, to the obtained result: 
    57 + 63 = 120.
Therefore, the correct answer is 120, which is the smallest three-digit integer that satisfies the conditions of having a remainder of 1 when divided by 7 and a remainder of 5 when divided by 9.”,

Answer:120

Question:What is the remainder when $${{2}^{10}}$$ is divided by $$3$$? 

Process:To find the remainder when $2^{10}$ is divided by 3, we can calculate the value of $2^{10}$ and then divide it by 3.
Calculate the value of $2^{10}$:
$2^{10} = 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 = 1024$.
Divide 1024 by 3:
When we divide 1024 by 3, we get a quotient of 341 and a remainder of 1.
Therefore, the remainder when $2^{10}$ is divided by 3 is 1.

Answer:1

Question:There is such a positive integer: if it is divided by $$5$$, the remainder is $$3$$; if it is divided by $$6$$, the remainder is $$4$$; if it is divided by $$7$$, the remainder is $$1$$. Find the least possible value of such a number. 

Process:In this case, we have the following congruences:
x ≡ 3 (mod 5)
x ≡ 4 (mod 6)
x ≡ 1 (mod 7)
To find the least possible positive integer that satisfies the given conditions, we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT). 
First we can start by finding an integer divided by 5 remaining 3, divided by 6 equals zero, divided by 7 equals zero. So we multiply 6 and 7 and check its multiple can be divided by 5 remaining 3.
We multiply 6 and 7 to get 42 and then check which smallest multiple of 42 can give a remainder of 3 when devided by 5. So we can get 168.
Secondly we can start by finding an integer divided by 6 remaining 4, divided by 5 equals zero, divided by 7 equals zero. So we multiply 5 and 7 and check its multiple can be divided by 6 remaining 4.
We multiply 5 and 7 to get 35 and then check which smallest multiple of 35 can give a remainder of 4 when devided by 6. So we can get 70.
Thirdly we can start by finding an integer divided by 7 remaining 1, divided by 5 equals zero, divided by 6 equals zero. So we multiply 5 and 6 and check its multiple can be divided by 7 remaining 1.
We multiply 5 and 6 to get 30 and then check which smallest multiple of 30 can give a remainder of 7 when devided by 1. So we can get 120.
Then we add the three numbers 168+70+120=358.
Next we need to get the smallest multiple of 5 and 6 and 7, which is 210.
The final result we want to find is the smallest positive number 358+n*210.
We take n equal -1 to get the answer 358+(-1)*210=148.

Answer:148

Question:A two-digit integer has remainder $5$ when it is divided by $7$ and remainder $11$ when divided by $13$. What is the largest possible value of the number? 

Process:To find the largest possible value of the two-digit integer that satisfies the given conditions, let's approach the problem step by step:
Let's denote the two-digit integer as "x."
The first condition states that x leaves a remainder of 5 when divided by 7. We can write this as:
x ≡ 5 (mod 7)
The second condition states that x leaves a remainder of 11 when divided by 13. We can write this as:
x ≡ 11 (mod 13)
To find the largest possible value of x that satisfies both conditions, we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT).
First, let's solve the congruence x ≡ 5 (mod 7):
The possible values of x that satisfy this condition are: 5, 12, 19, 26, 33, 40, 47, 54, 61, 68, 75, 82, 89, 96.
Now, let's solve the congruence x ≡ 11 (mod 13):
The possible values of x that satisfy this condition are: 11, 24, 37, 50, 63, 76, 89, 102, 115, 128.
To find the largest possible value of x, we need to find the largest common value in both lists. Looking at the lists above, we see that the largest common value is 89.
Therefore, the largest possible value of the two-digit integer that satisfies the given conditions is 89.

Answer:89

Question:A division gives a quotient of $$12$$ and a remainder of $$3$$. What is the minimum value of the dividend?      Pip\\textquotesingle s Answer: The smallest possible divisor is $$1$$, so the minimum value of the dividend is $$1\\times12+3=15$$ 

Process:To find the minimum value of the dividend given a quotient of 12 and a remainder of 3, we can use the formula:
Dividend = (Quotient × Divisor) + Remainder
In this case, the given quotient is 12 and the remainder is 3.
To find the minimum value of the dividend, we need to determine the smallest possible divisor. Since the smallest possible divisor is 1, we can substitute these values into the formula:
Dividend = (12 × 1) + 3
Simplifying the expression:
Dividend = 12 + 3
Dividend = 15
Therefore, the minimum value of the dividend is 15.
