Let's use the relevant knowledge of permutation and combination problems to solve math problems. Here are some examples how to do it.


Question: There are $$5$$ girls and $$7$$ boys in a class. How many ways are there to form a group of $$4$$ if there must be at least $$1$$ boy in the group?

Process:
To determine the number of ways to form the group of 4 with at least 1 boy, we can use its inverse proposition to solve this problem.
    Since the inverse proposition of at least one item is that there are no items, 
    we can know that the inverse proposition of the problem is that: the number of ways a group of 4 students if there must be no boy in the group.
    To solve this problem, we can do as follows:
        First, we solve the the inverse proposition of the problem.
            Select 4 girls from the 5 available girls: C(5, 4) = 5 ways.
        Then, we calculate all possible scenarios.
            Select 4 students from all the available students.
            The number of all students is 5 + 7 = 12.
            So there is C(12, 4) = 495 ways.
        Finally, we remove the ways of inverse proposition from all ways.
            495 - 5 = 490
        So 490 is the number of ways to form the group of 4 with at least 1 boy.    
The answer is: 490.

Answer: 490



Question: There are $6$ people sitting around an eight-seater circular table. How many different orders are there for them to sit? (If we can get the same order after rotating the table, then we regard the two orders as the same one.) 

Process:
To find the number of different orders for the 6 people to sit around the circular table, we can use the concept of permutations.
We have 6 people and 8 seats on the circular table. 
The first person can choose any of the 8 seats. 
Once the first person is seated, the second person can choose any of the remaining 7 seats. 
Similarly, the third person can choose any of the remaining 6 seats, and so on.
Therefore, the total number of different orders for the people to sit is given by the product of the number of choices for each person:
8 choices for the first person × 7 choices for the second person × 6 choices for the third person × 5 choices for the fourth person × 4 choices for the fifth person × 3 choices for the sixth person.
This can be written as:
8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 = 20,160.
So, there are 20,160 different orders for the 6 people to sit around the circular table, considering that the same order after rotating the table is regarded as the same one.
The answer is: 20160.

Answer: 20160



Question: How many different ways are there to divide $30$ books to $5$ kids, to make sure each of them gets at least two books?

Process:
To divide 30 books among 5 kids, ensuring that each child receives at least two books, we can use a combinatorial approach.
First, we distribute 2 books to each child, which leaves us with 20 books to distribute freely among the 5 kids.
We can represent this problem using stars and bars. Let's denote the number of additional books received by each child as x1, x2, x3, x4, and x5, respectively.
We need to find the number of solutions to the equation x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 + x5 = 20, where xi represents the number of additional books received by the i-th child.
Using the stars and bars formula, the number of solutions to this equation is given by C(20 + 5 - 1, 5 - 1) or C(24, 4).
Using the binomial coefficient formula, C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!), we can calculate C(24, 4) as:
C(24, 4) = 24! / (4! * (24 - 4)!) = (24 * 23 * 22 * 21) / (4 * 3 * 2 * 1) = 10,626.
Therefore, there are 10,626 different ways to divide 30 books among 5 kids, ensuring that each child receives at least two books.
The answer is: 10626.

Answer: 10626




Question: Use all the digits $$9$$, $$0$$, $$2$$ and $$3$$ to form a number that is closest to $$2978$$.

Process:
To form a number using the digits 9, 0, 2, and 3 that is closest to 2978, we can analyze the digits and find the closest number to 2978.
Let's analyze the digits:
For the thousands digit, we found that the digit 2 is the closest number to the thousands digit of 2978, which is also 2.
So the thousands digit of new number can be set to 2.
The remaining digits are 9, 0, 3.
For the hundreds digit, we found that the digit 9 is the closest number to the thousands digit of 2978, which is also 9.
So the hundreds digit of new number can be set to 9.
The remaining digits are 0, 3.
For the tens digit, we found that the digit 3 is the closest number to the thousands digit of 2978, which is also 7.
The remaining digits are 0.
Since we have only one remaining digit, so the units digit is 0.
After the analysis, we can get the number 2930, which is the closest number to 2978.
The answer is 2930.

Answer: 2930




Question: Ali, Bala, Charles, Dan and Ella are standing side by side in a line to take a photo. If Ali and Bala must stand together and Dan must stand at the furthest left, how many different arrangements are there?

Process:
To determine the number of different arrangements of Ali, Bala, Charles, Dan, and Ella that satisfy the given conditions, we can treat Ali and Bala as a single entity (AB). 
This reduces the problem to arranging four objects: AB, Charles, Dan, and Ella.
Since Dan must stand at the furthest left, which means he has been arranged, we don't need to take him into account.
So we only need to arrange three objects: AB, Charles, and Ella.
Let's consider the different cases:
Case 1: Ali and Bala are arranged as AB.
In this case, we have AB, Charles, and Ella. We can arrange these three entities in 3! = 6 ways.
Case 2: Ali and Bala are arranged as BA.
In this case, we have BA, Charles, and Ella. We can arrange these three entities in 3! = 6 ways.
To obtain the total number of arrangements, we sum up the arrangements from both cases:
Total arrangements = Case 1 + Case 2 = 6 + 6 = 12
Therefore, there are 12 different arrangements of Ali, Bala, Charles, Dan, and Ella that satisfy the given conditions.
The answer is 12.

Answer: 12



Question: How many different ways are there to divide 13 oranges among 3 kids to ensure each of them gets at least two oranges?

Process: To ensure each child receives at least two oranges, we first distribute 2 oranges to each child, leaving 7 oranges to distribute freely. This problem can be approached using the stars and bars method. We define the additional number of oranges received by each child as x1, x2, and x3. We need to find the number of solutions to the equation x1 + x2 + x3 = 7. Using the combination formula, the number of solutions is given by C(9, 2). Thus, there are 36 different ways to distribute 13 oranges among 3 kids, ensuring each child receives at least two oranges.

Answer: 36



Question: A, B, C, and D are lining up to take a picture. A and B can only stand on the far right or far left. How many different ways can they line up?

Process: To solve this problem, we first consider the positions of A and B, as they are restricted to standing either on the far right or far left as a pair (AB or BA). There are 2 ways to arrange A and B (AB or BA). Once A and B are placed, the remaining two people, C and D, can stand in the middle in any order, resulting in 2! = 2 ways to arrange them. Therefore, the total number of different ways they can line up is the product of the ways to arrange A and B, the ways to arrange C and D, and the positions for A and B: Total arrangements = 2 (arrangements of A and B) × 2! (arrangements of C and D) × 2 (positions for A and B) = 2 × 2 × 2 = 8.

Answer: 8



Question: There are 10 red marbles, 5 blue marbles, and 8 green marbles in a bag. If Janice has only one chance to take marbles out of the bag without looking, what is the minimum number of marbles she must take out to ensure she gets at least 4 marbles of the same color?

Process: To ensure Janice gets at least 4 marbles of the same color, we consider the worst-case scenario where she picks the maximum number of marbles without getting 4 of the same color. First, she could pick 3 red marbles, but not the 4th to ensure she doesn't have 4 of the same color yet. Next, she could pick 3 blue marbles, and then 3 green marbles, still not having 4 of the same color. At this point, she has 3 red, 3 blue, and 3 green marbles. The next marble she picks, regardless of its color, will give her 4 marbles of that color. Thus, the minimum number of marbles she must take out is 3 (red) + 3 (blue) + 3 (green) + 1 (any color) = 10 marbles.

Answer: 10



Question: There are ten points on the circumference of a circle. How many triangles can be formed by using any three points as their vertices?

Process: To form a triangle, we need to choose any 3 points out of the 10 on the circle's circumference. The order of choosing points doesn't matter, as a triangle is defined by its three vertices regardless of the order. We use the combination formula C(10, 3) = 10! / (3! * 7!) = 120 to calculate the number of ways to choose 3 points out of 10. Therefore, there are 120 different triangles that can be formed.

Answer: 120


Question: Two different numbers are selected from 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, and 8. How many two-digit odd numbers can be formed?

Process: To form a two-digit odd number, the unit's digit must be odd, which can be 1 or 3 from the given digits. For the tens digit, we can use any of the remaining digits except 0 (to avoid a leading zero), resulting in 4 choices. Case 1: If the unit's digit is 1, we have 4 choices (2, 3, 6, 8) for the tens digit. Case 2: If the unit's digit is 3, there are again 4 choices (1, 2, 6, 8). Total possibilities are 4 + 4 = 8.

Answer: 8


Question: There are 37 students in class 3A. 18 of them join a sport class, 22 join a reading class. If each of them joins at least one of the classes, how many students join both classes?

Process: Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, first, we note that there are 37 students in total. Adding the students in sport and reading classes gives 40 (18 + 22). As this exceeds the total class count, some students are in both classes. Subtracting the total students from the sum in both classes (40 - 37) reveals that 3 students are in both the sport and reading classes.

Answer: 3


Question: There are 12 points on a circle such that the distances between adjacent pairs of points are all equal. How many right-angled triangles can be formed by joining any 3 of the points?

Process: To form a right-angled triangle on a circle, the hypotenuse must be a diameter. With 12 equidistant points, a diameter can be drawn through any 2 opposite points (6 arcs apart). There are 6 unique diameters (12 points divided by 2). For each diameter, we can choose the third point from the remaining 10 points, excluding 4 adjacent points to avoid a straight line. This leaves 6 choices for the third point. Therefore, for each of the 6 diameters, there are 6 choices for the third point, resulting in 6 diameters × 6 choices = 36 right-angled triangles.

Answer: 36


Question: 16 teachers from Think Academy participate in a badminton tournament, where they are paired off to compete with single elimination rules (the loser of each game is immediately eliminated from the tournament). How many games will be played to determine the winner?

Process: In a single elimination tournament, each game eliminates one participant. To determine the winner among 16 teachers, we need to eliminate 15 teachers. Each game eliminates one teacher, so the number of games needed to eliminate 15 teachers is 15. Therefore, 15 games will be played to determine the tournament winner.

Answer: 15


Question: There are 3 same biographies, 4 same science fictions, 2 same magazines, and 2 same practice books. Joe wants to put them in a line in his bookcase. How many different ways are there for him to put these books?

Process: To determine the arrangements, we consider that books of the same type are indistinguishable. The total number of books 
n is 3 (biographies) + 4 (science fictions) + 2 (magazines) + 2 (practice books) = 11. Arranging 11 distinct books can be done in 11! ways, but we must correct for overcounting the identical books. We divide by the factorial of the number of each type of book: 3! for biographies, 4! for science fictions, 2! for magazines, and 2! for practice books. The total arrangements are 11! / (3! * 4! * 2! * 2!). Calculating this gives the total number of ways Joe can arrange his books.The total number of different ways Joe can arrange the 3 biographies, 4 science fictions, 2 magazines, and 2 practice books in his bookcase is 69,300. ​

Answer: 69300


Question: How many different three-digit numbers can be made with cards that have 1, 3, and 6 on them? (Cards can be rotated)

Process: To find the number of different three-digit numbers, we consider permutations of the digits 1, 3, and 6. Each digit can be used in any of the three positions (hundreds, tens, units). We have 3 choices for each place, resulting in 3 choices for the hundreds place × 3 choices for the tens place × 3 choices for the units place = 3 × 3 × 3 = 27 different three-digit numbers.

Answer: 27


Question: An party has 7 dancing and 3 playing a sketch performances. Mike is deciding the order of these performances. If he wants to put at least 1 dancing performance between every 2 playing a sketch performances, how many different ways are there for him to arrange these performances?

Process:

First, place the 3 playing a sketch performances with gaps for dancing performances: _ P _ P _ P _.
We have 4 gaps (including start and end) to place the 7 dancing performances. Place 1 dancing performance in each of the 3 inner gaps: _ P D P D P D _.
Now, distribute the remaining 4 dancing performances in the 4 gaps. This can be solved using the stars and bars method.
Find the number of solutions to x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 = 4, where xi represents the additional dancing performances in the i-th gap.
Using the stars and bars formula, the number of solutions is given by C(7, 3) = 7! / (3! * 4!) = 35.
Therefore, there are 35 different ways to distribute the remaining 4 dancing performances.
The playing a sketch performances are distinct, so no further permutations are needed, similar for dancing performances.
Answer: 35


Question: How many 3-digit numbers are there where all 3 digits are odd?

Process:

We need to consider the number of odd digits available for each place value (hundreds, tens, and units). There are 5 odd digits: 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9.
For the hundreds place, any of the 5 odd digits can be used.
Similarly, for the tens and units places, any of the 5 odd digits can be used.
Since the choices for each place are independent, the total number of 3-digit numbers with all odd digits is the product of the choices for each place: 5 choices for the hundreds place × 5 choices for the tens place × 5 choices for the units place = 5 × 5 × 5.
Therefore, there are 125 different 3-digit numbers where all 3 digits are odd.
