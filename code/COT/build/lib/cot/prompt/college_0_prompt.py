Please read the following single-choice question and select the correct answer option (A, B, C, or D).

### Specific Method for Problem-Solving

1. **Chain of Thought**: Employ a step-by-step approach for your solution. 
2. **Self-Consistency Verification**: 
After selecting an answer, re-examine the problem with the chosen answer to ensure it aligns with the question and is logically consistent. If inconsistencies are found or you wish to reconsider your reasoning, you are encouraged to revise your answer.

Ensure to include the phrase **"Let's verify this answer for consistency"** immediately after your initial answer in your response. Following this statement, conduct a thorough verification of your answer. I will provide you an example.

Here is an example about how should you think and do it:
Q:

Let k be the number of real solutions of the equation e^x + x - 2 = 0 in the interval [0, 1], and let n be the number of real solutions that are not in [0, 1]. Which of the following is true?
 "options": ["k = 0 and n = 1", "k = 1 and n = 0", "k = n = 1", "k > 1"]

A:
Let's tackle this problem using the specified method.

### Step 1: Understand the Problem

We're given the equation \(e^x + x - 2 = 0\) and need to find the number of real solutions in the interval \([0, 1]\) (let's call this number \(k\)) and the number of real solutions outside this interval (\(n\)). We have to select the correct option from:

- A: \(k = 0\) and \(n = 1\)
- B: \(k = 1\) and \(n = 0\)
- C: \(k = n = 1\)
- D: \(k > 1\)

### Step 2: Solve the Problem

#### Examining the Interval [0, 1]

1. **At \(x = 0\),** \(e^0 + 0 - 2 = 1 - 2 = -1 < 0\).
2. **At \(x = 1\),** \(e^1 + 1 - 2 = e - 1 > 0\) since \(e \approx 2.718\).

Since the function changes sign from negative to positive as \(x\) increases from 0 to 1, by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there exists at least one real root in the interval \([0, 1]\). Thus, \(k \geq 1\).

#### Examining Solutions Outside [0, 1]

1. The function \(e^x + x - 2 = 0\) is continuously increasing because its derivative, \(e^x + 1\), is always positive for all real \(x\). This implies the function is strictly increasing and can cross the \(x\)-axis at most once.

Given this analysis, the function has exactly one real solution in the interval \([0, 1]\), and no solution outside this interval since it cannot cross the \(x\)-axis more than once.

### Initial Answer

The correct answer is **B: \(k = 1\) and \(n = 0\)**.

### Verification: Let's verify this answer for consistency

Given that \(e^x\) is an exponential function and always positive, and considering \(x\) ranges from 0 to 1, the function \(e^x + x - 2\) transitions from negative to positive across the interval. Since the function is continuously increasing, it ensures that any root (where the function equals zero) within this range is unique. This supports our answer of exactly one real solution within \([0, 1]\) and no solution outside it due to the function's strict monotonicity. Thus, our initial answer **B: \(k = 1\) and \(n = 0\)** holds upon verification for consistency with the problem statement and logical reasoning.

Answer: B
