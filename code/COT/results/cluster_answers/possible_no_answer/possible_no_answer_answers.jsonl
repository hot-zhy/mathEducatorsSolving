Square Array: Let's denote the total number of layers as n. The outermost layer will have boys, and the next layer will have girls, alternating as we move inward.\n2. Boys and Girls in Layers: In a square array, each layer from the second one onwards consists of 4 sides with (n-1) students each, minus the 4 corners which are counted twice. The outermost layer has 4n students.\n3. Total Boys and Girls: The total number of boys is the sum of students in the outermost and every other layer moving inward. The total number of girls is the sum of students in the layers between the boys' layers.\n4. Difference in Number: There are 52 more boys than girls.\n5. Equation: Let B represent the total number of boys and G represent the total number of girls. We have B - G = 52.\n6. Odd or Even Layers: If n is odd, the innermost layer will have boys; if n is even, the innermost layer will have girls.\n7. Find n: We need to find an n such that the difference between the sum of boys and girls is 52, considering the pattern of the layers.\n8. Calculate Total Students: Once we find n, we calculate the total number of students by adding the total number of boys and girls.\n\nLet's find n by considering the pattern of the layers. For each layer, we have:\n- Outermost layer (boys): 4n\n- Second layer (girls): 4(n-1) - 4\n- Third layer (boys): 4(n-2) - 4\n- Fourth layer (girls): 4(n-3) - 4\n- And so on...\n\nThe difference between boys and girls for the first two layers is:\n(4n) - (4(n-1) - 4) = 4n - 4n + 4 + 4 = 8\n\nFor each subsequent pair of layers (one boy layer and one girl layer), this difference will decrease by 8, since each layer has 4 fewer students on each side, and we subtract the 4 corners once for each layer.\n\nWe can set up an equation for the difference between boys and girls:\n8 + 8(n/2 - 1) = 52, where n/2 is the number of boy layers if n is even.\n\nSolving for n:\n8(n/2) = 52 + 8\n4n = 60\nn = 15\n\nSince n is odd, the innermost layer will have boys. Now we calculate the total number of students by adding up the students in each layer. We can do this by summing an arithmetic series where the first term is 4n and the last term is 4, with a common difference of -4.\n\nThe sum of an arithmetic series is given by:\nS = n/2 * (a1 + an)\n\nFor the boys:\nS_boys = (n/2 + 1) * (4n + 4)\nS_boys = 8 * (60 + 4) / 2\nS_boys = 8 * 64 / 2\nS_boys = 8 * 32\nS_boys = 256\n\nFor the girls, we subtract the outermost and innermost layers:\nS_girls = (n/2 - 1) * (4(n-1) + 4)\nS_girls = 7 * (4 * 14 + 4) / 2\nS_girls = 7 * 60 / 2\nS_girls = 7 * 30\nS_girls = 210\n\nTotal students = S_boys + S_girls\nTotal students = 256 + 210\nTotal students = 466\n\nAnswer: 466"] }

The outermost layer has s students on each side.\n3. Total Boys and Girls: The total number of boys will be the sum of students in the outermost layer and every second layer after that. The total number of girls will be the sum of students in every second layer starting from the second layer.\n4. Difference in Number: There are 32 more boys than girls.\n5.

We'll start with the smallest possible square array that follows the pattern described and increase the size until the difference between the number of boys and girls is 32.\n\nFor a single layer (smallest square), there would be no girls, only boys, so the difference would be the total number of boys, which is not enough information.\n\nFor two layers, the outer layer would have boys and the inner layer would have girls. The side length of the outer layer would be x and the inner layer would be x-2. The number of boys (b) would be x^2 and the number of girls (g) would be (x-2)^2.

The number of boys who can swim is 120 less than the number of boys who cannot swim. If we let the number of boys who cannot swim be x, then the number of boys who can swim is x - 120.\n6.

Let's denote the total number of layers of students as S and the total number of layers of teachers as T. Since the outermost layer is students and the innermost layer could be either students or teachers, we have two scenarios: S = T or S = T + 1.\n2. The difference in the number of people between the outer layer and the next inner layer is 4, because when moving inward, we lose one person from each of the four sides.\n3. If we denote the side length of the outermost student layer as n, then the number of students is n^2, and the number of teachers is (n-2)^2 if S = T, or (n-2)^2 + (n-4)^2 if S = T + 1.\n4. We are given that there are 80 more students than teachers. So, we have the equations:\n   - n^2 - (n-2)^2 = 80 for S = T, or\n   - n^2 - [(n-2)^2 + (n-4)^2] = 80 for S = T + 1.\n5. We solve these equations for n.\n6. For S = T, the equation simplifies to n^2 - (n^2 - 4n + 4) = 80, which simplifies to 4n - 4 = 80, and further to 4n = 84, so n = 21. This is not possible because it would mean there are no teachers.\n7. For S = T + 1, the equation simplifies to n^2 - (n^2 - 4n + 4) - (n^2 - 8n + 16) = 80, which simplifies to 4n - 4 - n^2 + 8n - 16 = 80, and further to -n^2 + 12n - 100 = 0.\n8. Solving the quadratic equation -n^2 + 12n - 100 = 0, we find the possible values for n.\n9. The quadratic equation factors to -(n - 10)(n - 2) = 0, giving n = 10 or n = 2. Since n = 2 would not allow for an inner layer of teachers, n must be 10.\n10. The total number of people is n^2 + (n-2)^2 + (n-4)^2, which is 10^2 + 8^2 + 6^2.\n11.

Multiples of 45: A number is a multiple of 45 if it is a multiple of both 5 and 9. For a number to be a multiple of 5, its last digit must be 0 or 5. Since the number is palindromic, the first and last digits must be the same, so the last digit must be 5 (it cannot be 0 because then the first digit would be 0, which is not allowed for a five-digit number).\n3.

The smallest possible value for B that satisfies this condition is 0, because 1 + 0 + 5 = 6, and we need to add 3 to make it 9, a multiple of 9. Thus, the smallest palindromic number is 50005.\n6.

The outermost layer has s students on each side.\n3. Total Boys and Girls: The total number of boys will be the sum of students in the outermost layer and every second layer after that. The total number of girls will be the sum of students in every second layer starting from the second layer.\n4. Difference in Number: There are 32 more boys than girls.\n5.

Square Array: Let's denote the total number of layers as n. The outermost layer will have boys, and the next layer will have girls, alternating as we move inward.\n2. Boys and Girls in Layers: In a square array, each layer from the second one onwards consists of 4 sides with (n-1) students each, minus the 4 corners which are counted twice. The outermost layer has 4n students.\n3. Total Boys and Girls: The total number of boys is the sum of students in the outermost and every other layer moving inward. The total number of girls is the sum of students in the layers between the boys' layers.\n4. Difference in Number: There are 52 more boys than girls.\n5. Equation: Let B represent the total number of boys and G represent the total number of girls. We have B - G = 52.\n6. Odd or Even Layers: If n is odd, the innermost layer will have boys; if n is even, the innermost layer will have girls.\n7. Find n: We need to find an n such that the difference between the sum of boys and girls is 52, considering the pattern of the layers.\n8. Calculate Total Students: Once we find n, we calculate the total number of students by adding the total number of boys and girls.\n\nLet's find n by considering the pattern of the layers. For each layer, we have:\n- Outermost layer (boys): 4n\n- Second layer (girls): 4(n-1) - 4\n- Third layer (boys): 4(n-2) - 4\n- Fourth layer (girls): 4(n-3) - 4\n- And so on...\n\nThe difference between boys and girls for the first two layers is:\n(4n) - (4(n-1) - 4) = 4n - 4n + 4 + 4 = 8\n\nFor each subsequent pair of layers (one boy layer and one girl layer), this difference will decrease by 8, since each layer has 4 fewer students on each side, and we subtract the 4 corners once for each layer.\n\nWe can set up an equation for the difference between boys and girls:\n8 + 8(n/2 - 1) = 52, where n/2 is the number of boy layers if n is even.\n\nSolving for n:\n8(n/2) = 52 + 8\n4n = 60\nn = 15\n\nSince n is odd, the innermost layer will have boys. Now we calculate the total number of students by adding up the students in each layer. We can do this by summing an arithmetic series where the first term is 4n and the last term is 4, with a common difference of -4.\n\nThe sum of an arithmetic series is given by:\nS = n/2 * (a1 + an)\n\nFor the boys:\nS_boys = (n/2 + 1) * (4n + 4)\nS_boys = 8 * (60 + 4) / 2\nS_boys = 8 * 64 / 2\nS_boys = 8 * 32\nS_boys = 256\n\nFor the girls, we subtract the outermost and innermost layers:\nS_girls = (n/2 - 1) * (4(n-1) + 4)\nS_girls = 7 * (4 * 14 + 4) / 2\nS_girls = 7 * 60 / 2\nS_girls = 7 * 30\nS_girls = 210\n\nTotal students = S_boys + S_girls\nTotal students = 256 + 210\nTotal students = 466\n\nAnswer: 466"]}
