Therefore, the suit cannot be Spades.\n\nThe only remaining numbers that are unique and would allow Eddie to know the card after Avril's statement are the 3 and 5 of Hearts.\n\nSince Avril knows the card for sure, it must be one of these two.

We can solve this system to find the values of M and W.\n\nFrom equation (2), we can express M in terms of W:\nM = W - 36 + 48\nM = W + 12  (3)\n\nSubstitute M from equation (3) into equation (1):\nW - 36 = (3/5)(W + 12)\n\nMultiply both sides by 5 to get rid of the fraction:\n5(W - 36) = 3(W + 12)\n\nExpand both sides:\n5W - 180 = 3W + 36\n\nCombine like terms:\n5W - 3W = 180 + 36\n2W = 216\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\nW = 108\n\nNow that we have W, we can find M using equation (3):\nM = W + 12\nM = 108 + 12\nM = 120\n\nThe total number of people at the bus stop initially was the sum of men and women:\nTotal = M + W\nTotal = 120 + 108\nTotal = 228\n\nAnswer: 228."]}

We can express this as:\nTotal grass = 70R \u00d7 8\n\nSince the total amount of grass is the same in both cases, we can set the two expressions equal to each other:\n14G \u00d7 15 = 70R \u00d7 8\n\nNow we can substitute G with 4R:\n14 \u00d7 4R \u00d7 15 = 70R \u00d7 8\n56R \u00d7 15 = 70R \u00d7 8\n\nNow we can solve for R:\n56 \u00d7 15 = 70 \u00d7 8\n840R = 560R\n\nSince R is on both sides, we can cancel it out, and we don't actually need to solve for R because we are interested in the total amount of grass, which is the same in both cases.\n\nNow we want to find out for how many days the pasture can feed 17 goats and 20 rabbits.

We need to find two sets of numbers, one set of two numbers and another set of three numbers, such that their products are equal. The numbers are 6, 12, 35, 175, 245, and 300.\n\nWe can start by looking for common factors and prime factorization of the numbers:\n- 6 = 2 * 3\n- 12 = 2^2 * 3\n- 35 = 5 * 7\n- 175 = 5^2 * 7\n- 245 = 5 * 7^2\n- 300 = 2^2 * 3 * 5^2\n\nWe notice that 35, 175, and 245 share the prime factors 5 and 7, and their product is a cube of 5 and a cube of 7, which can be split into a square and a single factor:\n35 * 175 * 245 = (5 * 7) * (5^2 * 7) * (5 * 7^2) = 5^4 * 7^4\n\nThis product can be split into two parts where one part is a square and the other is twice the square:\n(5^2 * 7^2) * (5^2 * 7^2) = (5^4 * 7^4)\n\nThe square of 5^2 * 7^2 is 1225, which is not in the list of numbers, but we can form 1225 by multiplying 35 and 35 (which is not possible since we don't have duplicate cards) or by multiplying 245 and 5. Since 5 is not a card itself, we need to find a combination that includes 5 as a factor.\n\nLooking at the remaining numbers, we see that 6 and 12 can be multiplied together to give a square number:\n6 * 12 = (2 * 3) * (2^2 * 3) = 2^3 * 3^2 = 72\n\nHowever, 72 is not a square number, and we cannot form a square number with the remaining cards (6, 12, and 300) that would match the square of 5^2 * 7^2.\n\nSince we cannot form a square number with the remaining cards, we need to look for a product of two cards that equals the product of three cards. We can see that 300 has a factor of 5^2, which is also present in 175 and 245. If we divide 300 by 5^2, we get 12, which is one of the cards. This means that 300 divided by 12 gives us 25, which is 5^2.\n\nSo, if Candy chose 12 and 300, the product would be 12 * 300 = 3600.\nCandice could then choose 35, 175, and 245, and the product would be 35 * 175 * 245.\n\nLet's calculate the product of Candice's cards:\n35 * 175 * 245 = 5 * 7 * 5^2 * 7 * 5 * 7^2 = 5^4 * 7^4\n\nNow, let's calculate 5^4 * 7^4:\n(5^2)^2 * (7^2)^2 = 25^2 * 49^2 = 625 * 2401 = 1500625\n\nSince 1500625 is not equal to 3600, we need to find a different combination.\n\nWe can try combining 6 and 300, which gives us:\n6 * 300 = 2 * 3 * 2^2 * 3 * 5^2 = 2^3 * 3^2 * 5^2 = 8 * 9 * 25 = 1800\n\nNow, we need to find a combination of three cards that also gives us 1800. We can try 12, 35, and 245:\n12 * 35 * 245 = 2^2 * 3 * 5 * 7 * 5 * 7^2 = 2^2 * 3 * 5^2 * 7^3 = 4 * 3 * 25 * 343 = 12 * 25 * 343 = 300 * 343 = 102900\n\nSince 102900 is not equal to 1800, this combination does not work either.\n\nWe need to find a combination of two cards that equals the product of three cards. Since 6 and 300 did not work, let's try 12 and 245:\n12 * 245 = 2^2 * 3 * 5 * 7^2 = 4 * 3 * 5 * 49 = 12 * 245 = 2940\n\nNow, we need to find a combination of three cards that also gives us 2940. We can try 6, 35, and 175:\n6 * 35 * 175 = 2 * 3 * 5 * 7 * 5^2 * 7 = 2 * 3 * 5^3 * 7^2 = 6 * 125 * 49 = 750 * 49 = 36750\n\nSince 36750 is not equal to 2940, this combination does not work either.\n\nWe need to find a combination of two cards that equals the product of three cards. Since 12 and 245 did not work, let's try 6 and 175:\n6 * 175 = 2 * 3 * 5^2 * 7 = 2 * 3 * 25 * 7 = 6 * 175 = 1050\n\nNow, we need to find a combination of three cards that also gives us 1050.

We can try 35, 175, and 245:\n35 * 175 * 245 = 5 * 7 * 5^2 * 7 * 5 * 7^2 = 5^4 * 7^4 = 625 * 2401 = 1500625\n\nSince 1500625 is not equal to 72, this combination does not work either.\n\nWe need to find a combination of two cards that equals the product of three cards. Since 6 and 12 did not work, let's try 6 and 300:\n6 * 300 = 2 * 3 * 2^2 * 3 * 5^2 = 2^3 * 3^2 * 5^2 = 8 * 9 * 25 = 1800\n\nNow, we need to find a combination of three cards that also gives us 1800. We can try 12, 35, and 245:\n12 * 35 * 245 = 2^2 * 3 * 5 * 7 * 5 * 7^2 = 4 * 3 * 5^2 * 7^3 = ", "generation": ["Process:\nLet's denote the numbers on the cards as A, B, C, D, E, and F. We need to find two sets of numbers, one set of two numbers and another set of three numbers, such that their products are equal. The numbers are 6, 12, 35, 175, 245, and 300.\n\nWe can start by looking for common factors and prime factorization of the numbers:\n- 6 = 2 * 3\n- 12 = 2^2 * 3\n- 35 = 5 * 7\n- 175 = 5^2 * 7\n- 245 = 5 * 7^2\n- 300 = 2^2 * 3 * 5^2\n\nWe notice that 35, 175, and 245 share the prime factors 5 and 7, and their product is a cube of 5 and a cube of 7, which can be split into a square and a single factor:\n35 * 175 * 245 = (5 * 7) * (5^2 * 7) * (5 * 7^2) = 5^4 * 7^4\n\nThis product can be split into two parts where one part is a square and the other is twice the square:\n(5^2 * 7^2) * (5^2 * 7^2) = (5^4 * 7^4)\n\nThe square of 5^2 * 7^2 is 1225, which is not in the list of numbers, but we can form 1225 by multiplying 35 and 35 (which is not possible since we don't have duplicate cards) or by multiplying 245 and 5. Since 5 is not a card itself, we need to find a combination that includes 5 as a factor.\n\nLooking at the remaining numbers, we see that 6 and 12 can be multiplied together to give a square number:\n6 * 12 = (2 * 3) * (2^2 * 3) = 2^3 * 3^2 = 72\n\nHowever, 72 is not a square number, and we cannot form a square number with the remaining cards (6, 12, and 300) that would match the square of 5^2 * 7^2.\n\nSince we cannot form a square number with the remaining cards, we need to look for a product of two cards that equals the product of three cards. We can see that 300 has a factor of 5^2, which is also present in 175 and 245. If we divide 300 by 5^2, we get 12, which is one of the cards. This means that 300 divided by 12 gives us 25, which is 5^2.\n\nSo, if Candy chose 12 and 300, the product would be 12 * 300 = 3600.\nCandice could then choose 35, 175, and 245, and the product would be 35 * 175 * 245.\n\nLet's calculate the product of Candice's cards:\n35 * 175 * 245 = 5 * 7 * 5^2 * 7 * 5 * 7^2 = 5^4 * 7^4\n\nNow, let's calculate 5^4 * 7^4:\n(5^2)^2 * (7^2)^2 = 25^2 * 49^2 = 625 * 2401 = 1500625\n\nSince 1500625 is not equal to 3600, we need to find a different combination.\n\nWe can try combining 6 and 300, which gives us:\n6 * 300 = 2 * 3 * 2^2 * 3 * 5^2 = 2^3 * 3^2 * 5^2 = 8 * 9 * 25 = 1800\n\nNow, we need to find a combination of three cards that also gives us 1800.

Since 6 and 300 did not work, let's try 12 and 245:\n12 * 245 = 2^2 * 3 * 5 * 7^2 = 4 * 3 * 5 * 49 = 12 * 245 = 2940\n\nNow, we need to find a combination of three cards that also gives us 2940.

Let's use the first equation:\n3(0.23) + 4P = 1.81\n0.69 + 4P = 1.81\n4P = 1.81 - 0.69\n4P = 1.12\nP = 1.12 / 4\nP = 0.28 kg\n\nNow we have the weight of an apple (A) and a pear (P), we can find the weight of 4 apples and 4 pears:\n4A + 4P = 4(0.23) + 4(0.28)\n4A + 4P = 0.92 + 1.12\n4A + 4P = 2.04 kg\n\nAnswer: 2.04 kg."]}

", "knowledge_point_routes": ["Overseas Competition->Knowledge Point->Number Theory Modules->Prime Factorization"], "answer": "Process:\nLet's denote the numbers as A = 6, B = 12, C = 35, D = 175, E = 245, and F = 300. We need to find two sets of numbers, one set with two numbers and another set with three numbers, such that the product of the numbers in each set is equal.\n\nWe can start by looking for pairs of numbers that are factors of the other numbers. For example, A (6) is a factor of B (12) and F (300), and B (12) is a factor of F (300). Similarly, C (35) is a factor of D (175) and E (245).\n\nNow, let's look for a common product. We can quickly see that the product of A (6) and F (300) is 1800, which is also the product of B (12), C (35), and D (175) because 12 * 35 * 5 = 12 * 175 = 2100, but that's not equal to 1800. We need to find a combination that multiplies to 1800.\n\nLet's try different combinations:\n- A * E = 6 * 245 = 1470 (not a match)\n- A * D = 6 * 175 = 1050 (not a match)\n- A * C = 6 * 35 = 210 (not a match)\n- B * E = 12 * 245 = 2940 (not a match)\n- B * D = 12 * 175 = 2100 (not a match)\n- B * C = 12 * 35 = 420 (not a match)\n\nSince none of these products match, we need to consider the possibility that the product involves the number 300 (F). We can divide 1800 by 300 to find a potential match:\n1800 / 300 = 6, which is A.\n\nSo, one set could be A (6) and F (300), and the other set would need to multiply to 1800. We can now look for a combination of three numbers that multiply to 1800.\n\nWe can divide 1800 by the remaining numbers to see if we get a product of two numbers that are in the list:\n- 1800 / B = 1800 / 12 = 150 (not a match)\n- 1800 / C = 1800 / 35 \u2248 51.43 (not a match)\n- 1800 / D = 1800 / 175 \u2248 10.29 (not a match)\n- 1800 / E = 1800 / 245 \u2248 7.35 (not a match)\n\nSince none of these divisions give us a product of two numbers that are in the list, we need to consider combinations of three numbers. We know that 300 (F) is already part of one set, so we can exclude it from the other set.\n\nLet's try multiplying the remaining numbers by each other:\n- B * C * D = 12 * 35 * 175 = 73500 (not a match)\n- B * C * E = 12 * 35 * 245 = 102900 (not a match)\n\nSince 300 (F) is a multiple of 6 (A), we can try to find a set of three numbers that includes 6 (A) and multiplies to 300. We can divide 300 by 6 to find the product of the remaining two numbers:\n300 / 6 = 50\n\nNow we need to find two numbers from the list whose product is 50, but there are no such numbers. Therefore, we need to reconsider our approach.\n\nLet's look at the prime factorization of the numbers:\n- A = 6 = 2 * 3\n- B = 12 = 2^2 * 3\n- C = 35 = 5 * 7\n- D = 175 = 5^2 * 7\n- E = 245 = 5 * 7^2\n- F = 300 = 2^2 * 3 * 5^2\n\nWe can see that 300 (F) has the prime factors 2^2, 3, and 5^2. If we take 6 (A) and 300 (F), we have the prime factors 2, 3, and 2^2, 3, 5^2. The product is 2^3 * 3^2 * 5^2, which is 1800.\n\nNow we need to find three numbers that, when multiplied, give us the same prime factors. We can see that 12 (B) and 35 (C) give us 2^2 * 3 and 5 * 7, respectively. If we multiply these with 5 (from D or E), we get 2^2 * 3 * 5 * 7, which is 420, not 1800.\n\nHowever, if we take 12 (B), 35 (C), and 175 (D), we get 2^2 * 3 * 5 * 7 * 5, which is 2^2 * 3 * 5^2 * 7, and that is 1800.\n\nSo, the sets are:\n- A (6) and F (300) = 6 * 300 = 1800\n- B (12), C (35), and D (175) = 12 * 35 * 175 = 1800\n\nThe number that was not picked is E (245).\n\nAnswer: 245.", "generation": ["Process:\nLet's denote the numbers as A = 6, B = 12, C = 35, D = 175, E = 245, and F = 300.

We can quickly see that the product of A (6) and F (300) is 1800, which is also the product of B (12), C (35), and D (175) because 12 * 35 * 5 = 12 * 175 = 2100, but that's not equal to 1800. We need to find a combination that multiplies to 1800.\n\nLet's try different combinations:\n- A * E = 6 * 245 = 1470 (not a match)\n- A * D = 6 * 175 = 1050 (not a match)\n- A * C = 6 * 35 = 210 (not a match)\n- B * E = 12 * 245 = 2940 (not a match)\n- B * D = 12 * 175 = 2100 (not a match)\n- B * C = 12 * 35 = 420 (not a match)\n\nSince none of these products match, we need to consider the possibility that the product involves the number 300 (F). We can divide 1800 by 300 to find a potential match:\n1800 / 300 = 6, which is A.\n\nSo, one set could be A (6) and F (300), and the other set would need to multiply to 1800. We can now look for a combination of three numbers that multiply to 1800.\n\nWe can divide 1800 by the remaining numbers to see if we get a product of two numbers that are in the list:\n- 1800 / B = 1800 / 12 = 150 (not a match)\n- 1800 / C = 1800 / 35 \u2248 51.43 (not a match)\n- 1800 / D = 1800 / 175 \u2248 10.29 (not a match)\n- 1800 / E = 1800 / 245 \u2248 7.35 (not a match)\n\nSince none of these divisions give us a product of two numbers that are in the list, we need to consider combinations of three numbers. We know that 300 (F) is already part of one set, so we can exclude it from the other set.\n\nLet's try multiplying the remaining numbers by each other:\n- B * C * D = 12 * 35 * 175 = 73500 (not a match)\n- B * C * E = 12 * 35 * 245 = 102900 (not a match)\n\nSince 300 (F) is a multiple of 6 (A), we can try to find a set of three numbers that includes 6 (A) and multiplies to 300. We can divide 300 by 6 to find the product of the remaining two numbers:\n300 / 6 = 50\n\nNow we need to find two numbers from the list whose product is 50, but there are no such numbers. Therefore, we need to reconsider our approach.\n\nLet's look at the prime factorization of the numbers:\n- A = 6 = 2 * 3\n- B = 12 = 2^2 * 3\n- C = 35 = 5 * 7\n- D = 175 = 5^2 * 7\n- E = 245 = 5 * 7^2\n- F = 300 = 2^2 * 3 * 5^2\n\nWe can see that 300 (F) has the prime factors 2^2, 3, and 5^2. If we take 6 (A) and 300 (F), we have the prime factors 2, 3, and 2^2, 3, 5^2. The product is 2^3 * 3^2 * 5^2, which is 1800.\n\nNow we need to find three numbers that, when multiplied, give us the same prime factors. We can see that 12 (B) and 35 (C) give us 2^2 * 3 and 5 * 7, respectively. If we multiply these with 5 (from D or E), we get 2^2 * 3 * 5 * 7, which is 420, not 1800.\n\nHowever, if we take 12 (B), 35 (C), and 175 (D), we get 2^2 * 3 * 5 * 7 * 5, which is 2^2 * 3 * 5^2 * 7, and that is 1800.\n\nSo, the sets are:\n- A (6) and F (300) = 6 * 300 = 1800\n- B (12), C (35), and D (175) = 12 * 35 * 175 = 1800\n\nThe number that was not picked is E (245).\n\nAnswer: 245."]}

We can consider the scenario where Dilly picks gloves without considering the color:\n\n- Dilly could pick 1 blue glove (either hand) and still not have a pair.\n- Dilly could then pick 2 green gloves (both left-hand or both right-hand) and still not have a pair.\n- The next glove Dilly picks must match with one of the previously picked gloves, either by color or by hand.\n\nSo the smallest number of gloves Dilly should bring is 1 (first blue) + 2 (two green) + 1 (the next glove, which must match) = 4 gloves.\n\nAnswer: 4."]}
