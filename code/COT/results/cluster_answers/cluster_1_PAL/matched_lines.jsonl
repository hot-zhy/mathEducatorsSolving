When Linda and Ted meet, the distance Linda has jogged is 1200 m.\n\nSince they start at the same time and meet at the same point, the time they jog is the same. Therefore, we can set up the following equation based on the ratio of their speeds and the distance Linda has jogged:\n\nDistance = Speed * Time\n\nFor Linda:\nDistance Linda jogged = 1200 m\n\nFor Ted:\nLet Distance Ted jogged = d\n\nSince their times are equal and the speed ratio is 3:4, we can write:\n\nTime Linda = Distance Linda / Speed Linda\nTime Ted = Distance Ted / Speed Ted\n\nSince Time Linda = Time Ted, we have:\n\nDistance Linda / Speed Linda = Distance Ted / Speed Ted\n1200 m / 3x = d / 4x\n\nCross-multiplying gives us:\n\n4x * 1200 m = 3x * d\n4800x = 3xd\n\nNow, we can solve for d:\n\nd = 4800x / 3x\nd = 1600 m\n\nThe length of the path is the sum of the distances jogged by Linda and Ted:\n\nLength of path = Distance Linda + Distance Ted\nLength of path = 1200 m + 1600 m\nLength of path = 2800 m\n\nAnswer: 2800"]}

According to the problem, Jerry travels three-sevenths of the distance L when they meet, so Kevin travels four-sevenths of the distance L.\n\nJerry's speed is given as a fraction of the road length per hour, which is 2/5 of L per hour. Kevin's speed is given as 80 mph.\n\nSince they start at the same time and meet at the same point, the time taken for both to meet is the same. Let's denote this time as T.\n\nJerry's distance when they meet is (3/7)L, and Kevin's distance when they meet is (4/7)L.\n\nUsing the formula distance = speed * time, we can write the equations for both Jerry and Kevin:\n\nJerry's distance: (3/7)L = (2/5)L * T\nKevin's distance: (4/7)L = 80 mph * T\n\nWe can solve for T from Jerry's equation:\n\nT = (3/7)L / (2/5)L\nT = (3/7) / (2/5)\nT = (3/7) * (5/2)\nT = 15/14\n\nNow we can substitute T into Kevin's equation to find L:\n\n(4/7)L = 80 mph * (15/14)\nL = (80 mph * (15/14)) / (4/7)\nL = (80 mph * (15/14)) * (7/4)\nL = 80 mph * (15/14) * (7/4)\nL = 80 * 15/2\nL = 1200/2\nL = 600\n\nSo the length of the road is 600 miles.\n\nAnswer: 600"]}

We'll denote the rate of inlet A as A and the rate of inlet B as B.\n\nInlet A fills the pool in 36 minutes, so its rate is 1/36 of the pool per minute.\nInlet B fills the pool in 48 minutes, so its rate is 1/48 of the pool per minute.\n\nThe pattern of opening the inlets is A for 1 minute, B for 2 minutes, A for 2 minutes, B for 1 minute, and then it repeats with A for 1 minute, B for 2 minutes, and so on.\n\nLet's calculate the amount of the pool filled in one complete cycle of this pattern:\nCycle: A (1 min) + B (2 min) + A (2 min) + B (1 min) = 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 6 minutes\n\nIn 6 minutes, the amount of the pool filled is:\nAmount filled by A in 3 minutes: 3 * (1/36)\nAmount filled by B in 3 minutes: 3 * (1/48)\n\nTotal amount filled in one cycle:\n(3/36) + (3/48) = (1/12) + (1/16)\n\nTo find a common denominator, we can use 48 (the least common multiple of 12 and 16):\n(4/48) + (3/48) = (7/48)\n\nSo, in one cycle of 6 minutes, 7/48 of the pool is filled.\n\nNow, we need to find how many complete cycles are needed to fill the pool. Let's denote the number of complete cycles as n.\n\nn * (7/48) = 1 (the pool is completely filled)\n\nTo find n, we divide both sides by (7/48):\nn = 1 / (7/48)\nn = 48 / 7\nn ≈ 6.857\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a cycle, we need to consider the next whole number of cycles, which is 7.\n\nNow, we calculate the total time taken for 7 cycles:\n7 cycles * 6 minutes per cycle = 42 minutes\n\nAfter 7 cycles, the pool is almost filled. We need to calculate the remaining part of the pool to be filled and how long it will take.\n\nAfter 7 cycles, the amount of the pool filled is:\n7 * (7/48) = 49/48, which is more than 1, meaning the pool is already filled before the end of the 7th cycle.\n\nSince we've overcounted, we need to subtract the last part of the cycle where the pool overflows. We'll go back one step in the cycle pattern to find the exact time.\n\nThe last part of the cycle is B for 1 minute, which we need to subtract:\nAmount filled by B in 1 minute: 1/48\n\nWe subtract this from the total amount filled after 7 cycles:\n(49/48) - (1/48) = (48/48) = 1\n\nSo, the pool is exactly filled just before the last B in the 7th cycle.\n\nThe time taken up to that point is:\n7 cycles * 6 minutes per cycle - 1 minute (last B not needed) = 42 minutes - 1 minute = 41 minutes\n\nTherefore, it takes 41 minutes to fill up the empty pool.\n\nAnswer: 41", "generation": ["Process:\nLet's calculate the rate at which each inlet fills the pool. We'll denote the rate of inlet A as A and the rate of inlet B as B.\n\nInlet A fills the pool in 36 minutes, so its rate is 1/36 of the pool per minute.\nInlet B fills the pool in 48 minutes, so its rate is 1/48 of the pool per minute.\n\nThe pattern of opening the inlets is A for 1 minute, B for 2 minutes, A for 2 minutes, B for 1 minute, and then it repeats with A for 1 minute, B for 2 minutes, and so on.\n\nLet's calculate the amount of the pool filled in one complete cycle of this pattern:\nCycle: A (1 min) + B (2 min) + A (2 min) + B (1 min) = 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 6 minutes\n\nIn 6 minutes, the amount of the pool filled is:\nAmount filled by A in 3 minutes: 3 * (1/36)\nAmount filled by B in 3 minutes: 3 * (1/48)\n\nTotal amount filled in one cycle:\n(3/36) + (3/48) = (1/12) + (1/16)\n\nTo find a common denominator, we can use 48 (the least common multiple of 12 and 16):\n(4/48) + (3/48) = (7/48)\n\nSo, in one cycle of 6 minutes, 7/48 of the pool is filled.\n\nNow, we need to find how many complete cycles are needed to fill the pool. Let's denote the number of complete cycles as n.\n\nn * (7/48) = 1 (the pool is completely filled)\n\nTo find n, we divide both sides by (7/48):\nn = 1 / (7/48)\nn = 48 / 7\nn ≈ 6.857\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a cycle, we need to consider the next whole number of cycles, which is 7.\n\nNow, we calculate the total time taken for 7 cycles:\n7 cycles * 6 minutes per cycle = 42 minutes\n\nAfter 7 cycles, the pool is almost filled. We need to calculate the remaining part of the pool to be filled and how long it will take.\n\nAfter 7 cycles, the amount of the pool filled is:\n7 * (7/48) = 49/48, which is more than 1, meaning the pool is already filled before the end of the 7th cycle.\n\nSince we've overcounted, we need to subtract the last part of the cycle where the pool overflows.
