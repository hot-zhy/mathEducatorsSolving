We can use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence:\nan = a1 + (n - 1)d\n99 = 7 + (n - 1)4\n92 = (n - 1)4\nn - 1 = 92 / 4\nn - 1 = 23\nn = 24\n\nNow that we know there are 24 rows, we can calculate the total number of seats by using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:\nS = n/2 * (a1 + an)\nS = 24/2 * (7 + 99)\nS = 12 * 106\nS = 1272\n\nTherefore, there are 1272 seats altogether in the theatre.\n\nAnswer:1272"]}

Since \\( n \\) and \\( a_1 + (n - 1) \\) must be factors of 900, we can start by finding the factors of 900 and testing which pairs could represent \\( n \\) and \\( a_1 + (n - 1) \\).\n\nThe factors of 900 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15, 18, 20, 25, 30, 36, 45, 50, 60, 75, 90, 100, 150, 180, 225, 300, 450, 900.\n\nWe need to find the largest factor \\( n \\) such that \\( a_1 \\) is an odd number. Since \\( a_1 \\) is odd, \\( n \\) must be even (because the sum of an odd number of odd numbers is odd, and we need an even sum). We can start by checking the largest even factors and see if they yield an odd \\( a_1 \\).\n\nThe largest even factor of 900 is 300. If \\( n = 300 \\), then:\n\n\\[ a_1 + (n - 1) = \\frac{900}{n} \\]\n\\[ a_1 + 299 = 3 \\]\n\\[ a_1 = 3 - 299 \\]\n\\[ a_1 = -296 \\]\n\nSince \\( a_1 \\) is not positive, we discard this option and move to the next even factor, which is 180. If \\( n = 180 \\), then:\n\n\\[ a_1 + 179 = 5 \\]\n\\[ a_1 = 5 - 179 \\]\n\\[ a_1 = -174 \\]\n\nAgain, \\( a_1 \\) is not positive. We continue this process until we find a positive \\( a_1 \\).\n\nAfter testing the even factors, we find that the largest even factor that gives a positive \\( a_1 \\) is 30. If \\( n = 30 \\), then:\n\n\\[ a_1 + 29 = \\frac{900}{30} \\]\n\\[ a_1 + 29 = 30 \\]\n\\[ a_1 = 30 - 29 \\]\n\\[ a_1 = 1 \\]\n\nSince \\( a_1 \\) is positive and odd, we have found the maximum number of terms.\n\nAnswer: 30"]}

Since the remainders are increasing and the remainder when divided by 9 is 1, a must be at least 10.\n\nWe can start with a = 10 and check multiples of 252 to find the smallest M that satisfies (M mod a) = 2. We can increase a if necessary until we find a suitable M.\n\nLet's start with a = 10 and M = 252k (where k is an integer) and check for the condition (M mod a) = 2.\n\nFor k = 1, M = 252 * 1 = 252, but (252 mod 10) ≠ 2.\nFor k = 2, M = 252 * 2 = 504, and (504 mod 10) = 4, which is not 2.\nWe can continue this process, but to expedite, we can notice that for M to have a remainder of 2 when divided by 10, M must end in a 2. The first multiple of 252 that ends in a 2 is when k = 6.\n\nFor k = 6, M = 252 * 6 = 1512, and (1512 mod 10) = 2.\n\nNow we check if M = 1512 satisfies the other conditions:\n(1512 mod 7) = 0 (remainder is 0)\n(1512 mod 9) = 1 (remainder is 1)\n(1512 mod 10) = 2 (remainder is 2)\n(1512 mod 28) = 3 (remainder is 3)\n\nSince all conditions are satisfied, the smallest possible number M is 1512.\n\nAnswer:1512"]}

For 4 ◈ 7 = 21, we can try to find a relationship between the numbers 4, 7, and 21.\n2. For 6 ◈ 22 = 20, we look for a relationship between 6, 22, and 20.\n3. For 8 ◈ 30 = 26, we look for a relationship between 8, 30, and 26.\n\nLooking at the examples, one possible pattern is that the result of \"◈\" is the product of the two numbers minus the first number:\n\n1. 4 ◈ 7 = (4 * 7) - 4 = 28 - 4 = 24 (which does not match the given 21, so we need to adjust our pattern)\n2. 6 ◈ 22 = (6 * 22) - 6 = 132 - 6 = 126 (which does not match the given 20, so we need to adjust our pattern)\n3. 8 ◈ 30 = (8 * 30) - 8 = 240 - 8 = 232 (which does not match the given 26, so we need to adjust our pattern)\n\nThe pattern does not seem to be consistent with multiplication and subtraction alone. Let's try another approach by looking for a pattern in the differences:\n\n1. 4 ◈ 7 = 21: The difference between the product (4 * 7 = 28) and the result (21) is 7.\n2. 6 ◈ 22 = 20: The difference between the product (6 * 22 = 132) and the result (20) is 112, which is 6 times 18 + 4.\n3. 8 ◈ 30 = 26: The difference between the product (8 * 30 = 240) and the result (26) is 214, which is 8 times 26 + 6.\n\nIt seems that the operation \"◈\" could be the product of the two numbers minus the first number times a certain value plus a constant.
