Since the divisor is actually 1.22 and not 122, the true result will be 99.396 more than the incorrect result. \n\nFirst, we need to find the incorrect result. To do this, we can divide the incorrect result by the divisor without the decimal point (122) and then add 99.396 to it:\n\nLet's call the dividend (the number being divided) \"x\".

We can rearrange the equation to solve for x:\n\nx = incorrect result * 122\n\nWe know the incorrect result is the true result minus 99.396, so we can substitute:\n\nx = (true result - 99.396) * 122\n\nSince we are given that the incorrect result is 99.396 less than the true result, we can set up the equation:\n\ntrue result = incorrect result + 99.396\n\nWe can now substitute the expression for the incorrect result from the previous equation:\n\ntrue result = ((true result - 99.396) * 122) + 99.396\n\nTo solve for the true result, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation.
