Find the cube root of 28512.\n2. Check if the cube root is a whole number.\n3. If it is, then h must be a factor of 28512 that when divided gives the cube root.\n\nLet's calculate the cube root of 28512:\n$$ \\sqrt[3]{28512} = 30.4 $$\nSince 30.4 is not a whole number, we need to find a factor of 28512 that is a perfect cube.\n\nThe prime factorization of 28512 is:\n$$ 28512 = 2^4 \\times 3^3 \\times 11 $$\n\nTo make it a perfect cube, we need to have all prime factors raised to a power that is a multiple of 3. Here, 3 is already raised to the power of 3, but 2 is raised to the power of 4, and 11 is raised to the power of 1.\n\nWe need to multiply by 2^2 to make the power of 2 a multiple of 3 (2^6), and we need to multiply by 11^2 to make the power of 11 a multiple of 3 (11^3).\n\nSo, the smallest number we can multiply by to get a cube is 2^2 * 11^2 = 4 * 121 = 484.\n\nTherefore, h must be 484 to make 28512/h a perfect cube.\n\nAnswer: 484"]}

Apply the Notation: For each term $$\\left\\{\\frac{2018+k}{5}\\right\\}$$, where $$k$$ ranges from 1 to 2018, we need to find the fractional part.\n3. Simplify the Terms: Since the numerator increases by 1 each time, the fractional part will cycle every 5 terms because the floor function will \"reset\" after every multiple of 5.\n4.

To find b, we need a value such that $$\\frac{1}{b+\\frac{1}{4}}$$ is close to $$\\frac{1}{20}$$ but less than it. Since $$\\frac{1}{5} = 0.2$$ and $$\\frac{1}{6} = 0.166...$$, we choose $$b = 5$$ because $$\\frac{1}{5} = 0.2$$ is closer to $$\\frac{1}{20} = 0.05$$.\n7. Calculate the remaining fraction after subtracting $$\\frac{1}{b+\\frac{1}{4}}$$ from 20: $$20 - \\frac{1}{5} = 20 - \\frac{4}{20} = \\frac{96}{20} = \\frac{19}{4}$$.\n8. Now we have $$a = \\frac{19}{4}$$, but since a must be a whole number, we can rewrite $$\\frac{19}{4}$$ as $$4 + \\frac{3}{4}$$, which gives us $$a = 4$$.\n9. Finally, calculate the expression $$a + 2b + 3c$$ using the values of a, b, and c we found: $$a + 2b + 3c = 4 + 2(5) + 3(4) = 4 + 10 + 12 = 26$$.\n\nAnswer: 26"]}

After removing all the 5s (and corresponding 2s to make 10s), we will be left with a product of numbers that do not contribute to trailing zeros.\n3. Multiply the remaining factors modulo 10 to find the last non-zero digit (when read from left to right, which is the first non-zero digit when read from right to left).\n\nHowever, this process is computationally intensive. A simpler approach is to use a mathematical trick that involves dividing by 10 until the last non-zero digit is found, taking into account the number of 2s and 5s in the factorization.\n\nLet's use Python to simplify the process:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import factorial\n\n# Define the product A\nA = factorial(2010) // (factorial(2008) * 2009)\n\n# Function to find the last non-zero digit of A\ndef last_non_zero_digit(n):\n    # Remove all trailing zeros\n    while n % 10 == 0:\n        n //= 10\n    # Return the last digit\n    return n % 10\n\n# Find the last non-zero digit of A\nlast_digit = last_non_zero_digit(A)\n```\n\nThe last non-zero digit of A is the output of the function last_non_zero_digit(A).\n\nAnswer: The first non-zero digit of A when read from right to left is the output of the function last_non_zero_digit(A). However, without running the code, we cannot provide the exact digit."]}
