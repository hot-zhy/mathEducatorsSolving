According to the information given, the ratio of Scan's age to Ted's age is 1:4, which can be expressed as:\nS / T = 1 / 4\n\nFrom this, we can express Scan's age in terms of Ted's age:\nS = T / 4\n\nThe ratio of their ages 4 years from now will be 1:3, which can be expressed as:\n(S + 4) / (T + 4) = 1 / 3\n\nSubstituting the expression for S in terms of T, we get:\n(T / 4 + 4) / (T + 4) = 1 / 3\n\nMultiplying both sides by 3(T + 4) to clear the fractions, we get:\n3(T / 4 + 4) = T + 4\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n3T / 4 + 12 = T + 4\n\nMultiplying everything by 4 to clear the fraction, we get:\n3T + 48 = 4T + 16\n\nSubtracting 3T from both sides, we get:\n48 = T + 16\n\nSubtracting 16 from both sides, we get:\nT = 32\n\nNow that we have Ted's age, we can find Scan's age using the initial ratio:\nS = T / 4\nS = 32 / 4\nS = 8\n\nNow we need to find how many years ago the ratio of their ages was 1:9. Let's denote the number of years ago as Y. The ratio of their ages Y years ago can be expressed as:\n(S - Y) / (T - Y) = 1 / 9\n\nSubstituting the values of S and T, we get:\n(8 - Y) / (32 - Y) = 1 / 9\n\nCross-multiplying to solve for Y, we get:\n9(8 - Y) = 32 - Y\n\nExpanding both sides, we get:\n72 - 9Y = 32 - Y\n\nAdding 9Y to both sides and subtracting 32 from both sides, we get:\n72 - 32 = 9Y - Y\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n40 = 8Y\n\nDividing both sides by 8, we get:\nY = 5\n\nTherefore, the ratio of their ages was 1:9 five years ago.\n\nAnswer: 5"]}

On Brian's 14th birthday, his father was 41, so we have:\nB = 14 (Brian's age)\nF = 41 (Father's age)\n\nThe next time Brian's age is the reverse of his father's age, Brian will be older than 14. We are looking for two ages, B and F, such that the digits of B are the reverse of F, and the difference in their ages remains the same (F - B = 41 - 14 = 27).\n\nWe can set up an equation to represent the relationship between Brian's age and his father's age in the future:\nF = B + 27\n\nNow we need to find a value for B such that the digits of B are the reverse of F. Since B is a two-digit number, let's denote the tens digit as \"t\" and the ones digit as \"u\". Then B can be represented as 10t + u and F as 10u + t.\n\nUsing the equation F = B + 27, we can substitute the expressions for B and F:\n10u + t = 10t + u + 27\n\nNow we can solve for u and t:\n10u - u = 10t - t + 27\n9u = 9t + 27\nu = t + 3\n\nSince u and t are digits, the possible values for t are 1, 2, ..., 6 (t cannot be 7, 8, or 9 because u would then be 10, 11, or 12, which are not digits). We can check each possible value of t to find a corresponding u that satisfies the condition u = t + 3.\n\nFor t = 1, u = 4 (B = 14, F = 41, but this is the initial condition, so we skip it)\nFor t = 2, u = 5 (B = 25, F = 52, which satisfies the condition)\n\nTherefore, the next time Brian's age is the reverse of his father's age, Brian will be 25 years old.\n\nAnswer: 25"]}

According to the information given, when Leo was his son's current age, his son was 4 years old. We can express this as:\n    L - S = S - 4\nThis simplifies to:\n    L - 2S = -4 ...(1)\n\nThe son also says that when he reaches Leo's current age, Leo will be 70 years old. We can express this as:\n    L + (L - S) = 70\nThis simplifies to:\n    2L - S = 70 ...(2)\n\nNow we have a system of two equations with two variables:\n    L - 2S = -4 ...(1)\n    2L - S = 70 ...(2)\n\nWe can solve this system by multiplying equation (1) by 2 and then subtracting it from equation (2):\n    2L - 4S = -8 ...(3) (equation (1) multiplied by 2)\n    2L - S = 70 ...(2)\n\nSubtract equation (3) from equation (2):\n    (2L - S) - (2L - 4S) = 70 - (-8)\n    2L - S - 2L + 4S = 70 + 8\n    3S = 78\n\nDivide both sides by 3:\n    S = 78 / 3\n    S = 26\n\nNow that we have the son's age, we can find Leo's age by substituting S into equation (1) or (2). Let's use equation (1):\n    L - 2S = -4\n    L - 2(26) = -4\n    L - 52 = -4\n\nAdd 52 to both sides:\n    L = -4 + 52\n    L = 48\n\nTherefore, Leo's current age is 48 years old.\n\nAnswer: 48"]}

According to the information given, Efron is 30 years younger than Danny, so we can write the following equation:\nE = D - 30\n\nWe are also given that the current ratio of Danny's age to Efron's age is 8:3. This can be expressed as:\nD/E = 8/3\n\nSubstituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:\nD/(D - 30) = 8/3\n\nCross-multiplying to solve for D, we have:\n3D = 8(D - 30)\n3D = 8D - 240\n240 = 8D - 3D\n240 = 5D\nD = 240/5\nD = 48\n\nNow that we have Danny's age, we can find Efron's age:\nE = D - 30\nE = 48 - 30\nE = 18\n\nLet's denote the number of years in the future when the ratio of their ages will be 5:3 as \"y\". The future ages of Danny and Efron will be D + y and E + y, respectively. The future ratio can be expressed as:\n(D + y)/(E + y) = 5/3\n\nSubstituting the known values of D and E into the equation, we get:\n(48 + y)/(18 + y) = 5/3\n\nCross-multiplying to solve for y, we have:\n3(48 + y) = 5(18 + y)\n144 + 3y = 90 + 5y\n144 - 90 = 5y - 3y\n54 = 2y\ny = 54/2\ny = 27\n\nTherefore, in 27 years' time, the ratio of Danny's age to Efron's age will be 5:3.\n\nAnswer: 27"]}
