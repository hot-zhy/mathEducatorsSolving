Therefore, the minimum number of students wearing the same size of uniforms is 11 + 1 = 12.\n\nAnswer: 12", "generation": ["Process:\nTo find the minimum number of students wearing the same size of uniforms, we can use the Pigeonhole Principle. The Pigeonhole Principle states that if n items are put into m containers, with n > m, then at least one container must contain more than one item.\n\nIn this case, we have 35 students (items) and 3 sizes of uniforms (containers: L, M, S). We want to find the minimum number of students wearing the same size, which means we want to find the maximum number of students that can be evenly distributed among the sizes without exceeding that number.\n\nTo evenly distribute the students among the 3 sizes, we divide the total number of students by the number of sizes:\n35 students / 3 sizes = 11 remainder 2.\n\nThis means that if we distribute the students evenly, each size will have at least 11 students. However, since there is a remainder of 2 when dividing 35 by 3, at least one size must have more than 11 students. Therefore, the minimum number of students wearing the same size of uniforms is 11 + 1 = 12.\n\nAnswer: 12"]}

So, we need to add these cases back in.\n\nThe number of ways in which exactly one entrance is used by all four people is \\(3\\) (since there are 3 entrances to choose from).\n\nThe number of ways in which exactly two entrances are used by all four people is \\(C(3, 2) \\times 2^4\\) because we choose 2 out of the 3 entrances and then each of the four people has 2 choices.\n\nUsing the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we calculate the total number of ways as follows:\nTotal ways = \\(3^4\\) - (Number of ways with one entrance unused) + (Number of ways with two entrances unused)\n\nNumber of ways with one entrance unused = \\(3 \\times 1^4\\) (since all four people choose the same entrance)\nNumber of ways with two entrances unused = \\(C(3, 2) \\times 2^4\\)\n\nTotal ways = \\(3^4 - 3 \\times 1^4 + C(3, 2) \\times 2^4\\)\nTotal ways = \\(81 - 3 + 3 \\times 16\\)\nTotal ways = \\(81 - 3 + 48\\)\nTotal ways = \\(78 + 48\\)\nTotal ways = \\(126\\)\n\nAnswer: 126"]}
