Finding Exponents for N:\n   - The pairs of factors of 10 are (1, 10) and (2, 5).\n   - Since d must be at least 2, the only possible pair for (c+1, d+1) is (2, 5), which corresponds to (c, d) being (1, 4).\n\n6. Calculating M and N:\n   - If (a, b) is (2, 3), then M = \\(3^2 \\cdot 5^3\\).\n   - If (a, b) is (1, 5), then M = \\(3^1 \\cdot 5^5\\), but this cannot be the case since it would not have a HCF of 75 with N.\n   - Therefore, M must be \\(3^2 \\cdot 5^3\\).\n   - N must be \\(3^1 \\cdot 5^4\\), as determined by the exponents (c, d) being (1, 4).\n\n7. Sum of M and N:\n   - M = \\(3^2 \\cdot 5^3 = 9 \\cdot 125 = 1125\\).\n   - N = \\(3^1 \\cdot 5^4 = 3 \\cdot 625 = 1875\\).\n   - The sum of M and N is 1125 + 1875 = 3000.\n\nAnswer: 3000"]}

Understanding Palindromic Numbers: A five-digit palindromic number has the form $$ABCCBA$$, where A, B, and C are digits and A is not zero.\n\n2. Multiples of 45: A number is a multiple of 45 if it is a multiple of both 5 and 9. For a number to be a multiple of 5, its last digit must be 0 or 5. Since the number is palindromic, the first and last digits must be the same, so the last digit must be 5 (it cannot be 0 because then the first digit would be 0, which is not allowed for a five-digit number).\n\n3. Divisibility by 9: For a number to be divisible by 9, the sum of its digits must be a multiple of 9. In a palindromic number $$ABCCBA$$, the sum of its digits is $$2A + 2B + 2C$$. To be divisible by 9, $$A + B + C$$ must be a multiple of 9.\n\n4. Largest Palindromic Multiple of 45: To find the largest number, we want to maximize A, then B, then C. Since the last digit must be 5, A is 9 (the largest possible value). We then want to make B as large as possible while ensuring that the sum of the digits is a multiple of 9. The largest possible value for B that satisfies this condition is 4, because $$9 + 4 + 5 = 18$$, which is a multiple of 9. Thus, the largest palindromic number is $$94449$$.\n\n5. Smallest Palindromic Multiple of 45: To find the smallest number, we want to minimize A, then B, then C. Since the last digit must be 5, A is 1 (the smallest possible non-zero value). We then want to make B as small as possible while ensuring that the sum of the digits is a multiple of 9. The smallest possible value for B that satisfies this condition is 8, because $$1 + 8 + 5 = 14$$, and we need to add 4 to make it 18, a multiple of 9. Thus, the smallest palindromic number is $$10801$$.\n\n6.

However, some of these students might have already turned backwards because their numbers are also multiples of 4.\n3. Considering Overlaps (Multiples of 12): Since 12 is the least common multiple of 4 and 6, any student who reports a multiple of 12 would have already turned backwards in the first step. These students are (12, 24, 36, 48). There are ⌊50/12⌋=4 such students.\n4. Total Students Turned Backwards:\n- Initially, 12 students (multiples of 4) turn.\n- Additional 8 students (multiples of 6) turn, but this count includes those who already turned.\n- Subtract 4 students (multiples of 12) who were counted twice.\n- Total = 12 (multiples of 4) + 8 (multiples of 6) - 4 (counted twice) = 16 students.\n5. Students Still Facing the Teacher:\n- Total students = 50\n- Students turned = 16\n- Students still facing the teacher = 50 - 16 = 34\n6. The answer is 34.\n\nAnswer: 34"]}

Conclusion: The product will have 3 zeros at the end because we can only make 3 pairs of 2s and 5s.\n\nAnswer: 3"]}
