We can pair the numbers to simplify the calculation:\n\n(60 + 59) - (58 + 57) + (56 + 55) - (54 + 53) + ... + (4 + 3) - (2 + 1)\n\nEach pair of numbers being added together sums to 119 (since 60 + 59 = 119, 58 + 57 = 115 but we are subtracting so it's like adding 4 to 115 to get 119 again, and so on). There are 30 pairs of numbers (from 1 to 60, we have 60 numbers, and each pair contains 2 numbers, so 60/2 = 30 pairs).\n\nSo we have 30 pairs of 119:\n\n30 * 119 = 3570\n\nAnswer: 3570"]}
