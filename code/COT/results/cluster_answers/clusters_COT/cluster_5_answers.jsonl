After taking x kilograms from the small bucket, it has 45 - x kilograms left.\n4. According to the problem, the oil left in the big bucket is 12 times that in the small one: 89 - x = 12(45 - x).\n5. Solve the equation: 89 - x = 540 - 12x.\n6. Add 12x to both sides: 89 - x + 12x = 540 - 12x + 12x, which simplifies to 89 + 11x = 540.\n7. Subtract 89 from both sides: 11x = 540 - 89, which simplifies to 11x = 451.\n8. Divide both sides by 11: x = 451 / 11.\n9. Calculate x: x = 41.\n\nAnswer: 41"]}

So the new number of boys is 1.5g + 12, and the new number of girls is g + 12.\n3. The ratio of boys to girls in the afternoon is 19:14, which means (1.5g + 12) / (g + 12) = 19/14.\n4. Cross-multiply to solve for g: 14(1.5g + 12) = 19(g + 12).\n5. Simplify and solve for g: 21g + 168 = 19g + 228.\n6. Subtract 19g from both sides: 2g = 60.\n7. Divide by 2: g = 30.\n8. Calculate the number of boys in the morning: 1.5g = 1.5 * 30 = 45.\n9. Calculate the total number of children in the afternoon: (45 + 12) + (30 + 12) = 57 + 42 = 99.\n\nOllie's mistake was in the step where he calculated the total number of children. He used the incorrect ratio for the increase in the number of children, which should have been based on the actual number of boys and girls, not the units of increase.\n\nAnswer: 99"]}

If we denote the side length of the outermost student layer as n, then the number of students is n^2, and the number of teachers is (n-2)^2 if S = T, or (n-2)^2 + (n-4)^2 if S = T + 1.\n4. We are given that there are 80 more students than teachers. So, we have the equations:\n   - n^2 - (n-2)^2 = 80 for S = T, or\n   - n^2 - [(n-2)^2 + (n-4)^2] = 80 for S = T + 1.\n5. We solve these equations for n.\n6. For S = T, the equation simplifies to n^2 - (n^2 - 4n + 4) = 80, which simplifies to 4n - 4 = 80, and further to 4n = 84, so n = 21.

For S = T + 1, the equation simplifies to n^2 - (n^2 - 4n + 4) - (n^2 - 8n + 16) = 80, which simplifies to 4n - 4 - n^2 + 8n - 16 = 80, and further to -n^2 + 12n - 100 = 0.\n8. Solving the quadratic equation -n^2 + 12n - 100 = 0, we find the possible values for n.\n9. The quadratic equation factors to -(n - 10)(n - 2) = 0, giving n = 10 or n = 2. Since n = 2 would not allow for an inner layer of teachers, n must be 10.\n10. The total number of people is n^2 + (n-2)^2 + (n-4)^2, which is 10^2 + 8^2 + 6^2.\n11.

According to the problem, Nicholas has 6 times the amount of money left as Alex does after spending. So, we can write the equation: x - 13 = 6(x - 58).\n4. Solve the equation: x - 13 = 6x - 348.\n5. Simplify and solve for x: 348 - 13 = 6x - x.\n6. This gives us 335 = 5x.\n7. Divide both sides by 5 to find x: x = 335 / 5.\n8. Calculate x: x = 67.\n9. Since both Alex and Nicholas started with x dollars each, the total amount they had at first is 2x.\n10. Calculate the total initial amount: 2x = 2 * 67.\n\nAnswer: 134"]}

Then, boys who cannot swim: 0.40 * B\n- Boys who can swim: B - (0.40 * B) = 0.60 * B\n- Equating the boys who can swim to the calculated number: 0.60 * B = Total pupils who can swim - 200\n- Solve for B to find the number of boys.\n- Subtract B from the total number of pupils to find the number of girls.\n\nLet's calculate:\n- Total pupils who can swim: 0.70 * 380 = 266\n- Boys who can swim: 266 - 200 = 66\n- 0.60 * B = 66\n- B = 66 / 0.60\n- B = 110\n- Number of girls: Total pupils - Number of boys = 380 - 110\n\nAnswer: 270"]}

Let's re-evaluate our approach.\n\nWe know that the difference in the number of boys and girls is 20, and the number of students on each layer is \\( 4n - 4 \\). Let's try a different approach by considering the actual layers:\n\n- If the square has \\( n \\) layers, then there are \\( n \\) layers of boys and \\( n-1 \\) layers of girls (since the outermost layer is boys).\n- The total number of boys is \\( 4n + 4(n-2) + 4(n-4) + \\ldots \\) until \\( n \\) is 1.\n- The total number of girls is \\( 4(n-1) + 4(n-3) + 4(n-5) + \\ldots \\) until \\( n-1 \\) is 1.\n\nLet's denote the side length of the square formed by boys as \\( s_b \\) and by girls as \\( s_g \\). The total number of boys is then \\( s_b^2 \\) and the total number of girls is \\( s_g^2 \\). Since the boys form the outer layer, \\( s_b = s_g + 2 \\) (because there is one layer of boys on each side of the square formed by girls).\n\nThe difference in the number of boys and girls is 20, so we have:\n\\[ s_b^2 - s_g^2 = 20 \\]\n\\[ (s_g + 2)^2 - s_g^2 = 20 \\]\n\\[ s_g^2 + 4s_g + 4 - s_g^2 = 20 \\]\n\\[ 4s_g + 4 = 20 \\]\n\\[ 4s_g = 16 \\]\n\\[ s_g = 4 \\]\n\nSince \\( s_g = 4 \\), the total number of girls is \\( s_g^2 = 16 \\). The total number of boys is \\( s_b^2 = (s_g + 2)^2 = 6^2 = 36 \\).\n\nThe total number of students is the sum of boys and girls:\n\\[ \\text{Total Students} = \\text{Total Boys} + \\text{Total Girls} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Total Students} = 36 + 16 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Total Students} = 52 \\]\n\nAnswer: 52"]}

Let y be the number of red beads she gave away and z be the number of green beads she gave away.\n4. The number of red beads left is x - y, the number of green beads left is x - z, and the number of blue beads left is x - 112.\n5. According to the problem, there are twice as many red beads as green beads left, so x - y = 2(x - z).\n6. The number of blue beads left is 50 fewer than the number of red beads left, so x - 112 = (x - y) - 50.\n7. The total number of beads left is the sum of the red, green, and blue beads left: (x - y) + (x - z) + (x - 112) = 350.\n8. Substitute the second equation into the third to get: (x - y) + (x - z) + ((x - y) - 50) = 350.\n9. Since x - y = 2(x - z), we can substitute 2(x - z) for x - y in the equation: 2(x - z) + (x - z) + (2(x - z) - 50) = 350.\n10. Simplify the equation: 5(x - z) - 50 = 350.\n11. Solve for x - z: 5(x - z) = 400, so x - z = 80.\n12. Now we have x - y = 2(x - z) which means x - y = 2 * 80 = 160.\n13. We have three equations now: x - y = 160, x - z = 80, and 3x - y - z - 112 = 350.\n14. Add y and z to both sides of the third equation: 3x - 112 = y + z + 350.\n15. Substitute the values of y and z from the first two equations: 3x - 112 = 160 + 80 + 350.\n16. Solve for x: 3x = 160 + 80 + 350 + 112, 3x = 702, x = 234.\n17.

After giving away beads, she has 350 beads left.\n3. Let y be the number of red beads she gave away and z be the number of green beads she gave away.\n4. The number of red beads left is x - y, the number of green beads left is x - z, and the number of blue beads left is x - 112.\n5. According to the problem, there are twice as many red beads as green beads left, so x - y = 2(x - z).\n6. The number of blue beads left is 50 fewer than the number of red beads left, so x - 112 = (x - y) - 50.\n7. The total number of beads left is the sum of the red, green, and blue beads left: (x - y) + (x - z) + (x - 112) = 350.\n8. Substitute the second equation into the third to get: (x - y) + (x - z) + ((x - y) - 50) = 350.\n9. Since x - y = 2(x - z), we can substitute 2(x - z) for x - y in the equation: 2(x - z) + (x - z) + (2(x - z) - 50) = 350.\n10. Simplify the equation: 5(x - z) - 50 = 350.\n11. Solve for x - z: 5(x - z) = 400, so x - z = 80.\n12. Now we have x - y = 2(x - z) which means x - y = 2 * 80 = 160.\n13.

All-Boy Teams: Let the number of all-girl teams be x. Then, the number of all-boy teams is 2x, according to the given information.\n4. Remaining Teams: The remaining teams are those with two or more boys, which is 27 teams. Since all-boy teams are a subset of this group, we subtract the all-boy teams from this number to get the teams with exactly two boys: 27 teams - 2x all-boy teams.\n5. Girls in Teams with Two Boys: Each team with exactly two boys has 1 girl. So, the number of girls in these teams is 27 - 2x.\n6. Total Girls: The total number of girls is the sum of girls in teams with only 1 boy, teams with exactly two boys, and all-girl teams: 30 + (27 - 2x) + 3x.\n7. Total Teams Equation: The sum of all types of teams should equal the total number of teams: 15 (one boy teams) + (27 - 2x) (two boys teams) + x (all-girl teams) + 2x (all-boy teams) = 50.\n8. Solving the Equation: 15 + 27 - 2x + x + 2x = 50, which simplifies to 42 + x = 50, so x = 50 - 42, which means x = 8.\n9. Total Girls Calculation: Now we can calculate the total number of girls: 30 (from one boy teams) + (27 - 2*8) (from two boys teams) + 3*8 (from all-girl teams) = 30 + 11 + 24 = 65.\n\nAnswer: 65"]}
