Since these remainders form an arithmetic sequence, there exists a common difference $d$ such that:\n\n$$\nr_9 = r_7 + d \\\\\nr_a = r_7 + 2d \\\\\nr_{28} = r_7 + 3d\n$$\n\nGiven that the remainders must be less than the divisors, we have $0 \\leq r_7 < 7$, $0 \\leq r_9 < 9$, $0 \\leq r_a < a$, and $0 \\leq r_{28} < 28$.\n\nSince 28 is a multiple of 7, the remainder when $M$ is divided by 28 must be a multiple of the remainder when $M$ is divided by 7.
