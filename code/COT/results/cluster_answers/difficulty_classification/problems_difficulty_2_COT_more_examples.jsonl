Let's use elimination.\n\nTo eliminate one of the variables, we can multiply the second equation by 3 and the first equation by 2, so the coefficients of E will be the same:\n3*(2N + 3E) = 3*439\n2*(9N + 5E) = 2*1440\n\nThis gives us:\n6N + 9E = 1317\n18N + 10E = 2880\n\nNow, let's multiply the first new equation by 2 and the second new equation by 3, so the coefficients of N will be the same:\n2*(6N + 9E) = 2*1317\n3*(18N + 10E) = 3*2880\n\nThis gives us:\n12N + 18E = 2634\n54N + 30E = 8640\n\nNow, let's subtract the first new equation from the second new equation to eliminate N:\n(54N + 30E) - (12N + 18E) = 8640 - 2634\n\nThis simplifies to:\n42N + 12E = 6006\n\nNow, let's divide the entire equation by 6 to simplify:\n7N + 2E = 1001\n\nNow we have a simpler equation. Let's go back to one of the original equations, for example, 2N + 3E = 439, and solve for one of the variables. Let's solve for N:\n7N + 2E = 1001\n2N + 3E = 439\n\nMultiply the second equation by 2 to match the coefficient of E in the first equation:\n4N + 6E = 878\n\nNow subtract the new equation from the first equation to eliminate E:\n(7N + 2E) - (4N + 6E) = 1001 - 878\n\nThis simplifies to:\n3N - 4E = 123\n\nNow we have two new equations:\n7N + 2E = 1001\n3N - 4E = 123\n\nWe can solve this system using substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution. From the second equation, we can express N in terms of E:\n3N = 123 + 4E\nN = (123 + 4E) / 3\n\nNow substitute N into the first equation:\n7((123 + 4E) / 3) + 2E = 1001\n\nMultiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:\n7(123 + 4E) + 6E = 3003\n\nExpand and simplify:\n861 + 28E + 6E = 3003\n\nCombine like terms:\n34E = 3003 - 861\n34E = 2142\n\nDivide by 34 to solve for E:\nE = 2142 / 34\nE = 63\n\nNow substitute E back into one of the equations to find N. Let's use 2N + 3E = 439:\n2N + 3*63 = 439\n2N + 189 = 439\n2N = 439 - 189\n2N = 250\nN = 250 / 2\nN = 125\n\nNow we have the cost of one necklace (N = 125) and one earring (E = 63). The total cost of one necklace and one earring is:\nN + E = 125 + 63 = 188\n\nAnswer: 188"]}

", "knowledge_point_routes": ["Overseas Competition->Knowledge Point->Word Problem Modules->Chicken-Rabbit Problems"], "answer": "Process:\nLet's denote the number of motorbikes as M, the number of tricycles as T, and the number of vans as V. \nMotorbikes have 2 wheels each, tricycles have 3 wheels each, and vans have 4 wheels each.\n\nFrom the given information, we can set up the following equations based on the number of wheels:\n1. 2M + 4V = 3T + 35 (35 more motorbike and van wheels than tricycle wheels)\n2. 3T + 4V = 2M + 13 (13 more tricycle and van wheels than motorbike wheels)\n3. 2M + 3T + 4V = 101 (total number of wheels)\n\nWe need to solve these equations to find the values of M, T, and V.\n\nFirst, let's subtract equation 2 from equation 1 to eliminate T:\n(2M + 4V) - (3T + 4V) = (3T + 35) - (2M + 13)\n2M - 3T + 4V - 4V = 3T + 35 - 2M - 13\n2M - 3T = 3T + 35 - 2M - 13\n4M - 6T = 22\nM - 1.5T = 5.5 (Equation 4)\n\nNow, let's use equation 3 to express T in terms of M and V:\n3T = 101 - 2M - 4V (Equation 5)\n\nSubstitute equation 5 into equation 4:\nM - 1.5(101 - 2M - 4V) = 5.5\nM - 151.5 + 3M + 6V = 5.5\n4M + 6V = 157\n2M + 3V = 78.5 (Equation 6)\n\nNow we have two equations with two variables (M and V):\n2M + 3V = 78.5 (Equation 6)\n2M + 4V = 3T + 35 (Equation 1)\n\nWe can solve for T using equation 5 and then use it to find M and V. However, we notice that the total number of wheels must be an integer, so the equation 2M + 3V = 78.5 seems incorrect because it implies that the number of wheels (which must be an integer) is a fraction. This suggests there might be a mistake in our calculations or assumptions.\n\nLet's re-evaluate our equations. We can use equation 3 directly to find the relationship between M and V since T will be eliminated:\n2M + 4V = 101 - 3T (Equation 7)\n\nNow, we can use equation 1 and equation 2 to find the relationship between M and V:\n2M + 4V - 3T = 35 (Equation 1)\n3T + 4V - 2M = 13 (Equation 2)\n\nAdding equation 1 and equation 2 to eliminate T:\n(2M + 4V - 3T) + (3T + 4V - 2M) = 35 + 13\n2M + 4V + 4V - 2M = 48\n8V = 48\nV = 6\n\nNow we can substitute V into equation 7 to find M:\n2M + 4(6) = 101 - 3T\n2M + 24 = 101 - 3T\n2M = 77 - 3T\n\nSince we don't have enough information to find T directly, we can use the fact that M, T, and V must all be whole numbers. We can test values of T to see which one results in a whole number for M. However, we can also notice that since V is 6, the number of van wheels is 4*6 = 24. If we subtract this from the total number of wheels, we get the number of wheels that are either motorbikes or tricycles:\n101 - 24 = 77 wheels\n\nNow, we can use the fact that there are 13 more tricycle and van wheels than motorbike wheels to find the number of motorbike wheels:\n3T + 4V = 2M + 13\n3T + 24 = 2M + 13\n3T + 11 = 2M\nSince we know that 2M + 3T = 77, we can substitute 3T from the equation above:\n2M + (2M - 11) = 77\n4M - 11 = 77\n4M = 88\nM = 22\n\nNow we have the number of motorbikes (M = 22) and the number of vans (V = 6). To find how many more motorbikes than vans there are, we subtract the number of vans from the number of motorbikes:\n22 - 6 = 16\n\nThere are 16 more motorbikes than vans.\n\nAnswer: 16", "generation": ["Process:\nLet's denote the number of motorbikes as M, the number of tricycles as T, and the number of vans as V. \nMotorbikes have 2 wheels each, tricycles have 3 wheels each, and vans have 4 wheels each.\n\nFrom the given information, we can set up the following equations based on the number of wheels:\n1. 2M + 4V = 3T + 35 (35 more motorbike and van wheels than tricycle wheels)\n2. 3T + 4V = 2M + 13 (13 more tricycle and van wheels than motorbike wheels)\n3. 2M + 3T + 4V = 101 (total number of wheels)\n\nWe need to solve these equations to find the values of M, T, and V.\n\nFirst, let's subtract equation 2 from equation 1 to eliminate T:\n(2M + 4V) - (3T + 4V) = (3T + 35) - (2M + 13)\n2M - 3T + 4V - 4V = 3T + 35 - 2M - 13\n2M - 3T = 3T + 35 - 2M - 13\n4M - 6T = 22\nM - 1.5T = 5.5 (Equation 4)\n\nNow, let's use equation 3 to express T in terms of M and V:\n3T = 101 - 2M - 4V (Equation 5)\n\nSubstitute equation 5 into equation 4:\nM - 1.5(101 - 2M - 4V) = 5.5\nM - 151.5 + 3M + 6V = 5.5\n4M + 6V = 157\n2M + 3V = 78.5 (Equation 6)\n\nNow we have two equations with two variables (M and V):\n2M + 3V = 78.5 (Equation 6)\n2M + 4V = 3T + 35 (Equation 1)\n\nWe can solve for T using equation 5 and then use it to find M and V. However, we notice that the total number of wheels must be an integer, so the equation 2M + 3V = 78.5 seems incorrect because it implies that the number of wheels (which must be an integer) is a fraction. This suggests there might be a mistake in our calculations or assumptions.\n\nLet's re-evaluate our equations. We can use equation 3 directly to find the relationship between M and V since T will be eliminated:\n2M + 4V = 101 - 3T (Equation 7)\n\nNow, we can use equation 1 and equation 2 to find the relationship between M and V:\n2M + 4V - 3T = 35 (Equation 1)\n3T + 4V - 2M = 13 (Equation 2)\n\nAdding equation 1 and equation 2 to eliminate T:\n(2M + 4V - 3T) + (3T + 4V - 2M) = 35 + 13\n2M + 4V + 4V - 2M = 48\n8V = 48\nV = 6\n\nNow we can substitute V into equation 7 to find M:\n2M + 4(6) = 101 - 3T\n2M + 24 = 101 - 3T\n2M = 77 - 3T\n\nSince we don't have enough information to find T directly, we can use the fact that M, T, and V must all be whole numbers. We can test values of T to see which one results in a whole number for M. However, we can also notice that since V is 6, the number of van wheels is 4*6 = 24. If we subtract this from the total number of wheels, we get the number of wheels that are either motorbikes or tricycles:\n101 - 24 = 77 wheels\n\nNow, we can use the fact that there are 13 more tricycle and van wheels than motorbike wheels to find the number of motorbike wheels:\n3T + 4V = 2M + 13\n3T + 24 = 2M + 13\n3T + 11 = 2M\nSince we know that 2M + 3T = 77, we can substitute 3T from the equation above:\n2M + (2M - 11) = 77\n4M - 11 = 77\n4M = 88\nM = 22\n\nNow we have the number of motorbikes (M = 22) and the number of vans (V = 6).
