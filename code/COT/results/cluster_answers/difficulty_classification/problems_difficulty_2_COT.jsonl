Add Equation 4 to Equation 5 to eliminate E:\n   (3N - 4E) + (8N + 12E) = 123 + 1756\n   11N + 8E = 1879 (Equation 6)\n7.

Add Equation 7 to Equation 6 to eliminate E:\n   (6N - 8E) + (11N + 8E) = 246 + 1879\n   17N = 2125\n10. Divide by 17 to find the cost of one necklace:\n    N = 2125 / 17\n    N = 125\n11.

Divide by 3 to find the cost of one earring:\n    E = 189 / 3\n    E = 63\n13. The total cost of 1 necklace and 1 earring is N + E:\n    Total cost = 125 + 63\n    Total cost = 188\n\nAnswer: 188"]}

Determine the probability of rolling a sum greater than 10 with two dice. The possible combinations are (5,6), (6,5), (6,6), so there are 3 favorable outcomes.\n2. There are a total of 6 sides on each die, so there are 6 * 6 = 36 possible outcomes when two dice are rolled.\n3. The probability of rolling a sum greater than 10 is 3/36 or 1/12.\n4. The expected value for one game is calculated by multiplying the probability of winning (£10) by the probability of the event occurring (1/12) and subtracting the probability of losing (£1) times the probability of that event occurring (11/12).\n5. Expected value for one game = (1/12 * £10) - (11/12 * £1) = £10/12 - £11/12 = -£1/12.\n6. Multiply the expected value for one game by the number of games played to find the total expected loss: -£1/12 * 60 = -£5.\n\nAnswer: -5"]}
