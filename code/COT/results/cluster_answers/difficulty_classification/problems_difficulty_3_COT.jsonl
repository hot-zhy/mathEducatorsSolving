Therefore, Ema had $K - 360$ dollars.\nEma spent 1/4 of her money, so she spent (1/4)(K - 360) dollars and was left with K - 360 - (1/4)(K - 360) dollars.\nKeng Wee spent 4/7 of his money, so he spent (4/7)K dollars and was left with K - (4/7)K dollars.\nAfter spending, they both had the same amount of money left, so we can set up the equation:\nK - 360 - (1/4)(K - 360) = K - (4/7)K\nSimplify the equation:\nK - 360 - (1/4)K + 90 = (3/7)K\nCombine like terms:\n(3/4)K - 270 = (3/7)K\nTo solve for K, we need to get all the K terms on one side and the constants on the other side. Multiply both sides by 28 (the least common multiple of 4 and 7) to eliminate the fractions:\n21K - 7560 = 12K\nSubtract 12K from both sides:\n9K = 7560\nDivide both sides by 9:\nK = 840\nSo, Keng Wee had $840 at first.\nAnswer: 840"]}

After receiving stickers from Marry and Alexis, Charlotte's stickers became c + 0.80c = 1.80c.\nThe total number of stickers Charlotte received is the sum of the stickers given by Marry and Alexis: 0.20 * (7/5)x + 0.20x.\nThis sum is equal to the increase in Charlotte's stickers, which is 0.80c. So we have the equation:\n0.20 * (7/5)x + 0.20x = 0.80c\nSimplifying the equation:\n(0.20 * 7/5 + 0.20)x = 0.80c\n(0.28 + 0.20)x = 0.80c\n0.48x = 0.80c\nNow, we know that Marry had 20 stickers more than Charlotte in the end. So we have:\n(7/5)x - 0.20 * (7/5)x = 1.80c + 20\nSimplifying the left side:\n(1 - 0.20) * (7/5)x = 1.80c + 20\n0.80 * (7/5)x = 1.80c + 20\nNow we can substitute 0.80c from the previous equation into this one:\n0.80 * (7/5)x = 0.48x + 20\nSolving for x:\n(0.80 * 7/5)x = 0.48x + 20\n(0.56)x = 0.48x + 20\n0.56x - 0.48x = 20\n0.08x = 20\nx = 20 / 0.08\nx = 250\nTherefore, Alexis initially had 250 stickers.\nAnswer: 250."]}

After this exchange, Sam had S - 0.20S = 0.80S stickers left, and Peter had P + 0.20S stickers.\n\nThen, Peter gave 25% of his new total stickers to Sam. This means Sam received 0.25(P + 0.20S) stickers from Peter. After this exchange, Peter had (P + 0.20S) - 0.25(P + 0.20S) = 0.75P + 0.15S stickers, and Sam had 0.80S + 0.25(P + 0.20S) stickers.\n\nIn the end, Sam had 96 stickers more than Peter, so we can write the equation:\n0.80S + 0.25(P + 0.20S) = (0.75P + 0.15S) + 96\n\nNow we can substitute the first equation (S = P + 40) into the second equation and solve for P:\n0.80(P + 40) + 0.25(P + 0.20(P + 40)) = (0.75P + 0.15(P + 40)) + 96\n\nSimplify and solve for P:\n0.80P + 32 + 0.25P + 0.05P + 2 = 0.75P + 0.15P + 6 + 96\n\nCombine like terms:\n1.10P + 34 = 0.90P + 102\n\nSubtract 0.90P from both sides:\n0.20P + 34 = 102\n\nSubtract 34 from both sides:\n0.20P = 68\n\nDivide both sides by 0.20:\nP = 68 / 0.20\nP = 340\n\nSo, Peter originally had 340 stickers.\n\nAnswer: 340"]}

To calculate this, we first find 7/20 of 1680:\n(7/20) * 1680 = 7 * 84 = 588.\n\nSo, in the second month, James sold 1680 + 588 = 2268 cookies.\n\nThe number of cookies James kept in the second month is C - 2268.\n\nAccording to the problem, the number of cookies James kept decreased by 3/20 from the first month to the second month. This decrease is 3/20 of the total number of cookies in the box, which is (3/20)*C.\n\nSo, we have the equation:\n(C - 1680) - (3/20)*C = C - 2268.\n\nNow, let's solve for C:\nC - 1680 - (3/20)*C = C - 2268\n(17/20)*C - 1680 = C - 2268\n(17/20)*C - C = -2268 + 1680\n(-3/20)*C = -588\nC = -588 / (-3/20)\nC = 588 * (20/3)\nC = 196 * 20\nC = 3920\n\nSo, there were 3920 cookies in the box.\n\nAnswer: 3920."]}
