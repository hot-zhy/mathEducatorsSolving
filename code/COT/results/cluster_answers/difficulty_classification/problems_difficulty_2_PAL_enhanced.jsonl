The Nim-sum is the bitwise XOR of the number of matches in each pile. If the Nim-sum is zero, then the position is losing for the player about to move; otherwise, it is winning.\n\nThe winning strategy is to always play in such a way that leaves a Nim-sum of zero for the opponent. In this case, we need to calculate the Nim-sum of the two piles and determine if Eddie, who goes first, has a winning strategy.\n\nLet's calculate the Nim-sum for the two piles:\n\n```\ndef solution():\n    # Number of matches in pile A and pile B\n    pile_A = 35\n    pile_B = 24\n\n    # Calculate the Nim-sum\n    nim_sum = pile_A ^ pile_B\n\n    # Determine the winning strategy\n    if nim_sum == 0:\n        # If the Nim-sum is zero, Eddie does not have a winning strategy\n        winning_strategy = \"Wei'er\"\n    else:\n        # If the Nim-sum is not zero, Eddie has a winning strategy\n        winning_strategy = \"Eddie\"\n\n    result = winning_strategy\n    return result\n```\n\nThe code will return who has the winning strategy based on the Nim-sum. If Eddie has a winning strategy, he should play in such a way that leaves a Nim-sum of zero for Wei'er. If the Nim-sum is already zero, then Wei'er has the winning strategy."]}
