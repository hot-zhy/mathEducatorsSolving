We need to find all combinations of 'a' and 'b' such that a + b = 15.\n\nSince 'a' and 'b' are digits, the maximum value for 'a' or 'b' is 9. We can list out the possible combinations for 'a' and 'b':\n- a = 6, b = 9\n- a = 7, b = 8\n- a = 8, b = 7\n- a = 9, b = 6\n\nHowever, we must also consider that the year cannot exceed 2108. Therefore, the combination where 'a' is 9 and 'b' is 6 is not valid because it would result in the year 2196, which is beyond our range.\n\nThus, we have three valid combinations for 'a' and 'b':\n- a = 6, b = 9 (invalid as explained above)\n- a = 7, b = 8\n- a = 8, b = 7\n\nFor each valid combination of 'a' and 'b', there is exactly one lucky year. Therefore, there are 2 lucky years between 2018 and 2108.\n\nAnswer: 2."]}

Then we can write the following equations based on the ratios:\n0.60A / CpP = 3 / 2\nCpP / CmM = 1 / 5\n\nSince P = (4/5)A and M = (2/5)A, we can substitute these into the equations:\n0.60A / Cp(4/5)A = 3 / 2\nCp(4/5)A / Cm(2/5)A = 1 / 5\n\nSimplifying the equations:\n0.60 / (4/5)Cp = 3 / 2\n(4/5)Cp / (2/5)Cm = 1 / 5\n\nFrom the first equation, we can solve for Cp:\n0.60 / (4/5)Cp = 3 / 2\n0.60 = (3/2) * (4/5)Cp\n0.60 = (6/5)Cp\nCp = (5/6) * 0.60\nCp = 0.50\n\nNow we know the cost per pear is $0.50. Using the second ratio, we can find Cm:\n(4/5) * 0.50 / (2/5)Cm = 1 / 5\n2 * 0.50 / Cm = 1 / 5\n1 / Cm = 1 / 5\nCm = 5\n\nNow we know the cost per mango is $5.00.\n\nSince the total cost for all fruits is $150, we can write the total cost equation:\n0.60A + 0.50P + 5.00M = 150\n\nSubstituting P and M in terms of A:\n0.60A + 0.50(4/5)A + 5.00(2/5)A = 150\n0.60A + 0.40A + 2.00A = 150\n3.00A = 150\nA = 150 / 3\nA = 50\n\nNow we know John bought 50 apples. We can find the number of pears and mangoes:\nP = (4/5) * 50 = 40\nM = (2/5) * 50 = 20\n\nThe total number of fruits John bought is the sum of apples, pears, and mangoes:\nTotal fruits = A + P + M\nTotal fruits = 50 + 40 + 20\nTotal fruits = 110\n\nAnswer: 110."]}

So there are 8 ways to reach the 5th step.\n\nNext, we need to find the number of ways to go from the 5th step to the 10th step. This is similar to finding the number of ways to climb a flight of 5 steps, since Nelson is starting from the 5th step. The sequences of steps he can take are: 1-1-1-1-1, 1-1-1-2, 1-1-2-1, 1-2-1-1, 2-1-1-1, 2-2-1, 2-1-2, 1-2-2. So there are also 8 ways to go from the 5th step to the 10th step.\n\nSince the two parts are independent of each other, we can multiply the number of ways to reach the 5th step by the number of ways to go from the 5th step to the 10th step to find the total number of different ways Nelson can climb up the 10 steps.\n\nTotal number of ways = Number of ways to reach 5th step * Number of ways from 5th to 10th step\nTotal number of ways = 8 * 8 = 64\n\nAnswer: 64."]}
