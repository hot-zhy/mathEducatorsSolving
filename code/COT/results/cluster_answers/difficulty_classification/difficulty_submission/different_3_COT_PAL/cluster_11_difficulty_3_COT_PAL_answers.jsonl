", "knowledge_point_routes": ["Overseas Competition->Knowledge Point->Combinatorics->Patterns of Figures->Change of Quantity"], "answer": "420", "generation": ["Process:\nLet's assume Peter initially had x cookies. Since John had 180 more cookies than Peter, John initially had x + 180 cookies.\nAfter John sold 4/5 of her cookies, she was left with 1/5 of her initial amount, which is (1/5)(x + 180).\nAfter Peter sold 3/10 of his cookies, he was left with 7/10 of his initial amount, which is (7/10)x.\nAccording to the problem, John had 1/2 as many cookies as Peter left. So we can set up an equation:\n(1/5)(x + 180) = (1/2)(7/10)x\nNow we can solve this equation to find the value of x, which represents the initial number of cookies Peter had.\nMultiplying both sides by 10 to clear the denominators:\n2(x + 180) = (7/2)x\nExpanding the left side:\n2x + 360 = (7/2)x\nMultiplying both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:\n4x + 720 = 7x\nSubtracting 4x from both sides:\n720 = 3x\nDividing by 3:\nx = 240\nSo Peter initially had 240 cookies.\nTo find the number of cookies John had initially, we can add 180 to Peter's initial amount:\nJohn initially had 240 + 180 = 420 cookies.\nThe answer is the initial number of cookies John had.\nAnswer: 420"]}
