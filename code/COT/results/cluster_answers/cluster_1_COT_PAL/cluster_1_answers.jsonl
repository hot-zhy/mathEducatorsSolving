On the (n-1)th day, the worm would have climbed (n-1) meters in total. On the nth day, the worm climbs 3 meters, which should be enough to reach the surface.\n\nWe need to find the last day when the worm is still in the well, which is when the total distance climbed is just less than the depth of the well (8 meters). We can set up the following inequality:\n\n(n-1) * 1 meter < 8 meters\nn - 1 < 8\nn < 9\n\nThe worm must climb to a point where it is less than 8 meters from the bottom, but as soon as it climbs 3 meters on the next day, it will reach or exceed the 8-meter mark and escape the well.\n\nSo, on the 8th day, the worm starts at 7 meters climbed. It then climbs 3 meters during the day, reaching a total of 10 meters, which is above the well's depth. Therefore, the worm will reach the ground on the 8th day.\n\nAnswer: 8"]}

When the length is increased by 12 cm, the new length becomes L + 12 cm.\n\nThe perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula:\nPerimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)\n\nAccording to the problem, the perimeter of the new rectangle is 38 cm. So we can write the equation for the new perimeter as:\n38 cm = 2 * ((L + 12 cm) + W)\n\nNow, we need to find the perimeter of the original rectangle, which is:\nPerimeter_original = 2 * (L + W)\n\nFrom the equation of the new perimeter, we can express L + W in terms of the new perimeter:\n38 cm = 2 * L + 24 cm + 2 * W\n38 cm - 24 cm = 2 * L + 2 * W\n14 cm = 2 * (L + W)\n\nNow, we divide both sides by 2 to find L + W:\n14 cm / 2 = L + W\n7 cm = L + W\n\nThe perimeter of the original rectangle is therefore:\nPerimeter_original = 2 * (L + W)\nPerimeter_original = 2 * 7 cm\nPerimeter_original = 14 cm\n\nAnswer: 14"]}

We also denote the levels of Zachary, Yvonne, Xavier, and Waylon as z, y, x, and w respectively. We have the following information:\n\n1) A is higher than C but lower than D: c < a < d\n2) B is lower than Xavier: b < x\n3) D is 5 times Yvonne's level: d = 5y\n4) If Zachary moves up two levels, the difference between his new level (z+2) and Xavier's level (x) is the same as the difference between his new level (z+2) and Waylon's level (w): |(z+2) - x| = |(z+2) - w|\n5) The level Zachary stays is the sum of the levels Yvonne and Xavier stay: z = y + x\n\nWe need to find the level that A stays in, which is a.\n\nFrom (3), we know that D's level is a multiple of 5, and since D lives in a building with 18 levels, D can only live on level 5, 10, or 15. However, since A lives below D, and C lives below A, D cannot live on level 5 because that would not leave enough room for A and C to have distinct levels below D. Therefore, D must live on level 10 or 15.\n\nIf D lives on level 10, then Yvonne lives on level 2 (since d = 5y). However, this would not allow for Zachary's level to be the sum of Yvonne's and Xavier's levels (since the maximum sum z could be is 2 + 17 = 19, which is greater than 18). Therefore, D must live on level 15, and Yvonne lives on level 3 (since d = 5y).\n\nNow we have:\nd = 15\ny = 3\n\nUsing (5), we have:\nz = y + x\nz = 3 + x\n\nFrom (4), we have:\n|(z+2) - x| = |(z+2) - w|\nSubstituting z = 3 + x, we get:\n|(3 + x + 2) - x| = |(3 + x + 2) - w|\n|5| = |(5 + x) - w|\n5 = |5 + x - w|\n\nSince the absolute value of a number is always non-negative, and the left side of the equation is 5, we know that (5 + x - w) must be either 5 or -5.\n\nIf (5 + x - w) = 5, then x - w = 0, which means x = w. This cannot be true because Xavier and Waylon live on different levels.\n\nIf (5 + x - w) = -5, then x - w = -10. Since the maximum level is 18, and x cannot be greater than 18, w cannot be less than 1. Therefore, the only possible values for x and w that satisfy this equation are x = 8 and w = 18.\n\nNow we have:\nx = 8\nw = 18\nz = 3 + x = 3 + 8 = 11\n\nWe know that B is lower than Xavier (b < x), so B cannot be on level 8 or higher. Since Zachary is on level 11, B cannot be Zachary. Since D is on level 15, B cannot be D. Therefore, B must be Yvonne, who is on level 3.\n\nNow we have:\nb = y = 3\n\nSince A is higher than C but lower than D, and D is on level 15, A must be on a level higher than 3 (since B is Yvonne on level 3) and lower than 15.

We also denote the levels of Zachary, Yvonne, Xavier, and Waylon as z, y, x, and w respectively. We have the following information:\n\n1) A is higher than C but lower than D: c < a < d\n2) B is lower than Xavier: b < x\n3) D is 5 times Yvonne's level: d = 5y\n4) If Zachary moves up two levels, the difference between his new level (z+2) and Xavier's level (x) is the same as the difference between his new level (z+2) and Waylon's level (w): |(z+2) - x| = |(z+2) - w|\n5) The level Zachary stays is the sum of the levels Yvonne and Xavier stay: z = y + x\n\nWe need to find the level that A stays in, which is a.\n\nFrom (3), we know that D's level is a multiple of 5, and since D lives in a building with 18 levels, D can only live on level 5, 10, or 15. However, since A lives below D, and C lives below A, D cannot live on level 5 because that would not leave enough room for A and C to have distinct levels below D. Therefore, D must live on level 10 or 15.\n\nIf D lives on level 10, then Yvonne lives on level 2 (since d = 5y). However, this would not allow for Zachary's level to be the sum of Yvonne's and Xavier's levels (since the maximum sum z could be is 2 + 17 = 19, which is greater than 18). Therefore, D must live on level 15, and Yvonne lives on level 3 (since d = 5y).\n\nNow we have:\nd = 15\ny = 3\n\nUsing (5), we have:\nz = y + x\nz = 3 + x\n\nFrom (4), we have:\n|(z+2) - x| = |(z+2) - w|\nSubstituting z = 3 + x, we get:\n|(3 + x + 2) - x| = |(3 + x + 2) - w|\n|5| = |(5 + x) - w|\n5 = |5 + x - w|\n\nSince the absolute value of a number is always non-negative, and the left side of the equation is 5, we know that (5 + x - w) must be either 5 or -5.\n\nIf (5 + x - w) = 5, then x - w = 0, which means x = w. This cannot be true because Xavier and Waylon live on different levels.\n\nIf (5 + x - w) = -5, then x - w = -10. Since the maximum level is 18, and x cannot be greater than 18, w cannot be less than 1. Therefore, the only possible values for x and w that satisfy this equation are x = 8 and w = 18.\n\nNow we have:\nx = 8\nw = 18\nz = 3 + x = 3 + 8 = 11\n\nWe know that B is lower than Xavier (b < x), so B cannot be on level 8 or higher. Since Zachary is on level 11, B cannot be Zachary. Since D is on level 15, B cannot be D. Therefore, B must be Yvonne, who is on level 3.\n\nNow we have:\nb = y = 3\n\nSince A is higher than C but lower than D, and D is on level 15, A must be on a level higher than 3 (since B is Yvonne on level 3) and lower than 15.

According to the given ratio, \\( L:M = 2:3 \\). This means that for every 2 units of distance Luca covers, Max covers 3 units in the same time.\n\nLet's denote the time it takes for Max to cover the distance as \\( T \\) minutes. Therefore, Luca takes \\( T + 10 \\) minutes to cover the same distance.\n\nSince speed is inversely proportional to time when distance is constant, we can write the ratio of their times as \\( 3:2 \\) (which is the inverse of their speed ratio).\n\nNow, let's express their times to cover the distance:\nMax's time = \\( T \\)\nLuca's time = \\( T + 10 \\)\n\nUsing the ratio of their times (which is the inverse of their speeds), we have:\n\\( 3T = 2(T + 10) \\)\n\nNow, let's solve for \\( T \\):\n\\( 3T = 2T + 20 \\)\n\\( 3T - 2T = 20 \\)\n\\( T = 20 \\) minutes\n\nSo, Max takes 20 minutes to cover the distance, and Luca takes \\( 20 + 10 = 30 \\) minutes.\n\nIf Luca walked at double his usual speed, his speed ratio compared to Max would become \\( 4:3 \\), and the time ratio would be the inverse, \\( 3:4 \\). Since we know Luca's time at his usual speed is 30 minutes, we can find his time at double speed by setting up the proportion:\n\n\\( 3/4 = New\\ Time / 30 \\)\n\nSolving for the new time:\n\\( New\\ Time = (3/4) * 30 \\)\n\\( New\\ Time = 22.5 \\) minutes\n\nTherefore, it would take Luca 22.5 minutes to cover the distance at double his usual speed.\n\nAnswer: 22.5"]}

Now, let's see how many sets of 2 jumps the monkey needs to get to 40 meters or just below it, since the last jump may not follow the pattern if the monkey reaches the top.\n\nWe can calculate the number of full 7-meter climbs the monkey can make before reaching or exceeding 35 meters (40 meters - 5 meters, because in the last jump, the monkey can reach the top without falling):\n    35m / 7m = 5\nSo the monkey can make 5 full sets of 2 jumps, which is 5 * 2 = 10 jumps, to climb 35 meters.\n\nAfter 10 jumps, the monkey has climbed 35 meters. It now needs to make one final jump to reach or exceed the 40-meter mark. This final jump does not include a fall, so the monkey will reach the top with this jump.\n\nTherefore, the total number of jumps the monkey needs to make to reach the top of the tree is 10 + 1 = 11 jumps.\n\nAnswer: 11"]}
