Is Thomas\\textquotesingle s answer correct? If not, what is the correct answer? ", "knowledge_point_routes": ["Overseas Competition->Knowledge Point->Word Problem Modules->Solving Problems Involving Fractions and Percentages->Finding the Base"], "answer": "198.0", "generation": ["```\ndef solution():\n    # Thomas's solution is incorrect because he added the fractions incorrectly.\n    # The correct approach is to consider that Li Yan spent 1/3 on the book, leaving her with 2/3 of her money.\n    # Then she spent 1/2 of the remainder (which is 2/3) on the bag.\n    # So she spent 1/2 of 2/3, which is 1/3 of the original amount on the bag.\n    # Therefore, the book and the bag cost 1/3 + 1/3 = 2/3 of her original money.\n\n    # Let's denote the original amount of money Li Yan had as x.\n    # According to the problem, 2/3 of x equals $132.\n    # So we can set up the equation: 2/3 * x = 132\n\n    # Solve for x to find the original amount of money.\n    x = 132 / (2/3)\n\n    # Calculate the original amount of money.\n    result = x\n\n    return result\n```\n\nLet's execute the calculation step by step:\n\n1. Li Yan spent 1/3 of her money on a book, so she has 2/3 left.\n2. She then spent 1/2 of the remainder (which is 2/3 of the original amount) on a bag, which is 1/2 * 2/3 = 1/3 of the original amount.\n3. The total amount spent on the book and the bag is 1/3 + 1/3 = 2/3 of the original amount.\n4. Since the book and the bag cost $132 altogether, we can say that 2/3 of her original money is $132.\n5. To find the original amount, we divide $132 by 2/3, which is the same as multiplying $132 by 3/2.\n\nNow let's calculate the result:\n\n```\nresult = 132 * (3/2)\nresult = 198\n```\n\nSo the correct answer is that Li Yan had $198 at first."]}
