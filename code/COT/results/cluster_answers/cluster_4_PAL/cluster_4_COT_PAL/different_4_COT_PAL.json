Divisibility by 5: For a number to be divisible by 5, its last digit must be either 0 or 5. Since the number is a three-digit number starting with 6, the last digit must be 0 or 5. However, since the number is also divisible by 7, and there is no multiple of 7 that ends in 5 and starts with 6 in the range of three-digit numbers, the last digit must be 0.\n\n2. Divisibility by 3: For a number to be divisible by 3, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 3. The sum of the digits of the number 6**0 is 6 + 0 + 0 = 6, which is already divisible by 3. Therefore, the middle digit can be any digit that, when added to 6, results in a sum that is divisible by 3. Since the last digit is 0, the middle digit must be 3 or 6 or 9 to keep the sum divisible by 3.\n\n3. Divisibility by 7: We need to find a number starting with 6, ending with 0, and having a middle digit of 3, 6, or 9 that is divisible by 7. We can check the multiples of 7 in the range of 600 to 699 that end with 0.\n\n4. Checking Multiples of 7: The multiples of 7 in the range of 600 to 699 that end with 0 are 630 and 700. Since the number cannot be 700 (it's not in the form 6**0), the number must be 630.\n\n5. Verification: 630 is divisible by 3 (6 + 3 + 0 = 9, which is divisible by 3), by 5 (it ends with 0), and by 7 (630 \u00f7 7 = 90).\n\nThe answer is 630.\n\nAnswer: 630",

The first multiple of 24 that is greater than 60 is 72.\n5. Checking the Range: 72 is between 60 and 80 and is a multiple of both 3 and 8.\n6. The answer is 72.\n\nAnswer: 72",
