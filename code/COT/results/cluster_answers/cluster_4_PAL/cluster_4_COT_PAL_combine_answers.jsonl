This is a trial and error process.\n\n7. We can start with the smallest prime number, which is 2, and check if 2 + 1 = 3 and 2 + 6 = 8 are prime. 8 is not prime, so we move to the next prime number.\n\n8.

", "knowledge_point_routes": ["Overseas Competition->Knowledge Point->Number Theory Modules->Factors and Multiples->Common Factors and Common Multiples->Common Multiples and Least Common Multiples->Least Common Multiple of Multiple Numbers"], "cot_answer": "Process:\nTo solve the problem of finding Peter's age, we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT), which is a theorem in Number Theory that provides a solution to a system of simultaneous congruences with pairwise coprime moduli. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Set Up the Congruences: According to the problem, Peter's age when divided by 2, 4, or 6 leaves a remainder of 1, and when divided by 7, it leaves a remainder of 5. We can write these as congruences:\n   - Peter's age ≡ 1 (mod 2)\n   - Peter's age ≡ 1 (mod 4)\n   - Peter's age ≡ 1 (mod 6)\n   - Peter's age ≡ 5 (mod 7)\n\n2. Simplify the Congruences: Since all the first three congruences have the same remainder, we can look for a common multiple of 2, 4, and 6 that leaves a remainder of 1. The least common multiple (LCM) of 2, 4, and 6 is 12. However, since 4 and 6 are multiples of 2, any number that is congruent to 1 mod 4 and 1 mod 6 will also be congruent to 1 mod 2. Therefore, we only need to consider the congruences:\n   - Peter's age ≡ 1 (mod 4)\n   - Peter's age ≡ 1 (mod 6)\n   - Peter's age ≡ 5 (mod 7)\n\n3. Find the Least Common Multiple of 4 and 6: The LCM of 4 and 6 is 12. Since we are looking for a number that is 1 more than a multiple of 12, we can express this as:\n   - Peter's age ≡ 1 (mod 12)\n\n4. Apply the Chinese Remainder Theorem: Now we have two congruences to solve simultaneously:\n   - Peter's age ≡ 1 (mod 12)\n   - Peter's age ≡ 5 (mod 7)\n\n5. Find a Number That Satisfies Both Congruences: We need to find a number that, when divided by 12, leaves a remainder of 1, and when divided by 7, leaves a remainder of 5. We can do this by checking multiples of 12 and adding 1, until we find one that also satisfies the second congruence (≡ 5 mod 7).\n\n6. Checking Multiples of 12 Plus 1: We start with 12 * 1 + 1 = 13, which does not satisfy the second congruence. We continue with 12 * 2 + 1 = 25, 12 * 3 + 1 = 37, and so on, until we find a number that is also 5 more than a multiple of 7.\n\n7. Finding the Solution: By checking, we find that 12 * 4 + 1 = 49, which is not a solution. Then, 12 * 5 + 1 = 61, which is also not a solution. Continuing this process, we find that 12 * 6 + 1 = 73, which is 5 more than 68, a multiple of 7. Therefore, 73 satisfies both congruences.\n\n8. Conclusion: Peter's age is 73, which is the smallest number that satisfies all the given conditions.\n\nAnswer: 73", "cot_generation": ["Process:\nTo solve the problem of finding Peter's age, we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT), which is a theorem in Number Theory that provides a solution to a system of simultaneous congruences with pairwise coprime moduli. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Set Up the Congruences: According to the problem, Peter's age when divided by 2, 4, or 6 leaves a remainder of 1, and when divided by 7, it leaves a remainder of 5. We can write these as congruences:\n   - Peter's age ≡ 1 (mod 2)\n   - Peter's age ≡ 1 (mod 4)\n   - Peter's age ≡ 1 (mod 6)\n   - Peter's age ≡ 5 (mod 7)\n\n2. Simplify the Congruences: Since all the first three congruences have the same remainder, we can look for a common multiple of 2, 4, and 6 that leaves a remainder of 1. The least common multiple (LCM) of 2, 4, and 6 is 12. However, since 4 and 6 are multiples of 2, any number that is congruent to 1 mod 4 and 1 mod 6 will also be congruent to 1 mod 2. Therefore, we only need to consider the congruences:\n   - Peter's age ≡ 1 (mod 4)\n   - Peter's age ≡ 1 (mod 6)\n   - Peter's age ≡ 5 (mod 7)\n\n3. Find the Least Common Multiple of 4 and 6: The LCM of 4 and 6 is 12. Since we are looking for a number that is 1 more than a multiple of 12, we can express this as:\n   - Peter's age ≡ 1 (mod 12)\n\n4. Apply the Chinese Remainder Theorem: Now we have two congruences to solve simultaneously:\n   - Peter's age ≡ 1 (mod 12)\n   - Peter's age ≡ 5 (mod 7)\n\n5. Find a Number That Satisfies Both Congruences: We need to find a number that, when divided by 12, leaves a remainder of 1, and when divided by 7, leaves a remainder of 5. We can do this by checking multiples of 12 and adding 1, until we find one that also satisfies the second congruence (≡ 5 mod 7).\n\n6. Checking Multiples of 12 Plus 1: We start with 12 * 1 + 1 = 13, which does not satisfy the second congruence. We continue with 12 * 2 + 1 = 25, 12 * 3 + 1 = 37, and so on, until we find a number that is also 5 more than a multiple of 7.\n\n7. Finding the Solution: By checking, we find that 12 * 4 + 1 = 49, which is not a solution. Then, 12 * 5 + 1 = 61, which is also not a solution. Continuing this process, we find that 12 * 6 + 1 = 73, which is 5 more than 68, a multiple of 7. Therefore, 73 satisfies both congruences.\n\n8.

We can use a Python code to find the largest prime \\(x\\) that satisfies the condition:\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    if n <= 3:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:\n        return False\n    i = 5\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:\n            return False\n        i += 6\n    return True\n\n# Start from the largest prime number less than 200 and work down\nfor x in range(197, 1, -2):\n    if is_prime(x):\n        if (200 - 2*x) % (x - 1) == 0:\n            y = (200 - 2*x) // (x - 1)\n            if is_prime(y) and y != x:\n                largest_sum = x + y\n                break\n\nlargest_sum\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us the largest value of \\(x + y\\) where \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are different prime numbers that satisfy the given equation.\n\nAnswer: The largest value of \\(x + y\\) is the result of the Python code. @"], "pal_answer": "", "pal_generation": ["```\ndef solution():\n    # The problem is to find two different prime numbers x and y that satisfy the equation x(2 + y) = 200 + y.\n    # We can rearrange the equation to isolate y: xy + 2x = 200 + y, which gives us y(x - 1) = 200 - 2x.\n    # Since x and y are prime numbers, we can try to find a solution by testing prime numbers for x and solving for y.\n\n    # Initialize the largest sum of x and y\n    largest_sum = 0\n\n    # Since x is a prime number and it divides 200, we start testing from the largest prime number below 200\n    # and work our way down to find the largest possible sum of x and y.\n    for x in range(199, 1, -1):\n        # Check if x is prime\n        if all(x % i != 0 for i in range(2, int(x**0.5) + 1)):\n            # Solve for y using the rearranged equation\n            if (200 - 2 * x) % (x - 1) == 0:\n                y = (200 - 2 * x) // (x - 1)\n                # Check if y is prime and different from x\n                if y != x and all(y % i != 0 for i in range(2, int(y**0.5) + 1)):\n                    # Update the largest sum of x and y if this is the largest found so far\n                    largest_sum = max(largest_sum, x + y)\n                    # Since we are looking for the largest sum and we are iterating downwards, we can break after the first find\n                    break\n\n    result = largest_sum\n    return result\n```"]}
