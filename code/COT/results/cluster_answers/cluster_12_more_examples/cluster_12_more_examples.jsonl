This transformation ensures that y1, y2, y3, and y4 are non-negative integers that sum up to 15 - (1+2+3+4) = 5.\n\nNow we need to find the number of solutions to y1 + y2 + y3 + y4 = 5, where y1, y2, y3, and y4 are non-negative and distinct. This is a more complex problem because of the distinctness condition, and there isn't a straightforward formula for it. We would have to enumerate the possibilities, ensuring that no two yi's are the same.\n\nOne way to approach this is to consider the partitions of 5 into exactly 4 parts, where each part is distinct. These partitions are:\n- (5, 0, 0, 0) - not valid as we need distinct parts\n- (4, 1, 0, 0) - valid after adding 1, 2, 3, 4 to each part respectively\n- (3, 2, 0, 0) - valid after adding 1, 2, 3, 4 to each part respectively\n- (3, 1, 1, 0) - not valid as we need distinct parts\n- (2, 2, 1, 0) - not valid as we need distinct parts\n- (2, 1, 1, 1) - not valid as we need distinct parts\n\nFor each valid partition, we can permute the parts in 4! ways, but we must exclude permutations that result in non-distinct piles of candies. For the partition (4, 1, 0, 0), we have 4 choices for which pile gets 0 candies, and then 3! ways to arrange the remaining numbers, giving us 4 * 3! = 24 ways. For the partition (3, 2, 0, 0), we have 4 choices for which pile gets 0 candies, and then 3! / 2! (since 3 and 2 are distinct) ways to arrange the remaining numbers, giving us 4 * 3 = 12 ways.\n\nAdding these up, we get 24 + 12 = 36 ways to divide the candies into 4 distinct piles.\n\nAnswer: 36"]}

This is 7! since there are 7 distinct letters.\nNext, we find the number of arrangements where the vowels are together. We can treat the vowels AIO as a single entity, giving us 5 entities to arrange (AIO, R, N, B, W). This can be done in 5! ways. Within the AIO entity, the vowels can be arranged in 3! ways.\nThe number of arrangements where vowels are together is 5! * 3!.\nTo find the number of arrangements where vowels are never together, we subtract the number of arrangements where vowels are together from the total number of arrangements.\nTotal arrangements where vowels are never together = 7! - (5! * 3!).\nCalculating this gives:\n7! = 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 5040,\n5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120,\n3! = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6.\nSo, the number of arrangements where vowels are together = 120 * 6 = 720.\nTherefore, the number of arrangements where vowels are never together = 5040 - 720 = 4320.\n\nAnswer: 4320"]}

S1 + S2 + D1 + D2 = 55 (sum of their ages)\n2. S2 = S1 - 3 (sons are three years apart)\n3. D1 = D2 + 2 (daughters are two years apart)\n4. S2 = 2 * D1 (younger son is twice the age of the older daughter)\n\nUsing equation 4, we can express S2 in terms of D1: S2 = 2D1.\nSubstituting S2 from equation 2 into this expression gives us S1 - 3 = 2D1.\nRearranging, we get S1 = 2D1 + 3.\n\nNow we have S1 in terms of D1 and S2 in terms of D1. We can substitute S1 and S2 into equation 1:\n(2D1 + 3) + (2D1) + D1 + (D1 - 2) = 55\nCombining like terms, we get:\n6D1 + 1 = 55\n6D1 = 54\nD1 = 9\n\nNow that we have D1, we can find D2 using equation 3:\nD2 = D1 - 2\nD2 = 9 - 2\nD2 = 7\n\nTherefore, the youngest child, the younger daughter, is 7 years old.\n\nAnswer: 7"]}
