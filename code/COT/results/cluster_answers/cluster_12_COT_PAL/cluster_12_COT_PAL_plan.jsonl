Calculate the number of ways to arrange D, E, and the F-G unit.\n6. Multiply the results of steps 4 and 5 to get the total number of arrangements.\n\n**Calculation:**\n1.

Since there are 7 positions, A can be in the 4th position (the middle), and B and C can occupy the 1st and 7th positions or vice versa. This gives us 2 ways to arrange A, B, and C.\n2. F and G are considered as one unit (FG or GF), which gives us 2 ways to arrange them within their unit.\n3. Now we have 5 \"units\" to arrange: BAC, D, E, FG. Since D and E cannot be next to each other, we can place them in the following ways:\n   - Place D at one of the ends and E not next to D, or vice versa.\n   - Place FG at one of the ends, which leaves 3 spots for D and E to be placed without being next to each other.\n4. There are 4! (4 factorial) ways to arrange the 4 units (BAC, D, E, FG), but we must subtract the arrangements where D and E are next to each other.\n5. To find the number of invalid arrangements where D and E are next to each other, we can consider DE as a single unit. This gives us 3! ways to arrange BAC, DE, FG. However, DE can also be arranged as ED, so we multiply by 2.\n6. Subtract the number of invalid arrangements from the total number of arrangements to get the valid arrangements.\n\n**Answer:**\n1.

However, since the numbers are small, we can also attempt to solve it by systematically listing possibilities.\n\nWe need to find combinations of 4 positive integers that add up to 15, with each integer being distinct. We can start by finding the smallest possible number for the first pile and then find the combinations for the remaining piles.\n\nThe smallest number we can have in a pile is 1. After placing 1 in the first pile, we have 14 candies left to distribute in 3 piles. The next smallest number we can have is 2 (since piles must have different numbers). After placing 2 in the second pile, we have 12 candies left for 2 piles.

We must ensure that each pile has a different number of candies.\n\nLet's start with the smallest distribution and work our way up:\n\n1.

This is a problem of partitioning a number into a specific number of distinct parts.\n\n**Calculation:**\nTo solve this, we can use a method of generating functions or a combinatorial approach. However, since the numbers are small, we can also attempt to solve it by systematically listing possibilities.\n\nWe need to find combinations of 4 positive integers that add up to 15, with each integer being distinct. We can start by finding the smallest possible number for the first pile and then find the combinations for the remaining piles.\n\nThe smallest number we can have in a pile is 1. After placing 1 in the first pile, we have 14 candies left to distribute in 3 piles. The next smallest number we can have is 2 (since piles must have different numbers). After placing 2 in the second pile, we have 12 candies left for 2 piles. The smallest we can place in the third pile is now 3, leaving us with 9 candies for the last pile.\n\nHowever, we need to consider all possible distributions. We can systematically increase the number in the first pile and then find all possible combinations for the remaining piles. We must ensure that each pile has a different number of candies.\n\nLet's start with the smallest distribution and work our way up:\n\n1.

(n factorial).\n\nNumber of ways = 4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24\n\n2. Arranging two different colored pairs of socks:\nIn this case, we have two pairs of identical items. The number of arrangements is given by the formula for permutations of n items with duplicates, which is n! divided by the product of the factorials of the number of identical items.\n\nNumber of ways = 4! / (2! × 2!) = (4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / (2 × 1 × 2 × 1) = 6\n\n**Answer:**\n- There are 24 different ways to arrange four different colored socks.\n- There are 6 different ways to arrange two different colored pairs of socks.\n\nThe numbers are different because in the first scenario, each sock is unique, leading to more possible arrangements. In the second scenario, the presence of identical pairs reduces the number of unique arrangements since swapping the positions of identical socks does not create a new arrangement.\n\nFinal answer: 24 and 6"]}

Let's define our variables and plan our approach.\n\n**Variables:**\n- Total sum: 25\n- Number of different natural numbers: 7\n- Natural numbers: 1, 2, 3, ..., 24, 25 (since 25 is the limit)\n\n**Plan:**\n1. We will start by listing the smallest possible natural numbers and then increase them one by one while ensuring they are different and their sum is 25.\n2. We will ensure that the sum of the 7 numbers does not exceed 25 and that all numbers are unique.\n3. We will list all possible combinations.\n\n**Calculation:**\nLet's start with the smallest 7 different natural numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. Their sum is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7 = 28, which is already greater than 25, so we need to adjust our approach.\n\nSince 28 is too high, we need to reduce the sum by 3 to make it 25. We can do this by adjusting the largest number in our sequence. Instead of 7, we can use 4 (since 1, 2, and 3 are already in use), which gives us the sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 4. However, we need all numbers to be different, so we must adjust the sequence further.\n\nLet's try another approach by starting with the number 1 and finding the next possible smallest numbers that add up to 25:\n\n1. Start with 1, then add the next smallest numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 4 (as before, but we need to adjust the 4).\n2. Adjust the sequence to ensure all numbers are different and the sum is 25.\n\nWe can see that finding the combinations manually can be quite complex, so let's try a systematic approach:\n\n1. The smallest sum of 7 different natural numbers is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7 = 28. Since we need a sum of 25, we must replace one of these numbers with a smaller number that is not already in the list. The only way to do this is to replace the 7 with a 4, which is not allowed since 4 is already in the list.\n2. Since we cannot have 7 in our list, the next smallest sum of 6 different natural numbers is 1+2+3+4+5+6 = 21. We now have 4 remaining to reach 25, and we can add it as the 7th number since it's not in the list yet.\n3. Now we have the combination 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 4. To find more combinations, we can increase the last number step by step and decrease one of the other numbers to keep the sum at 25.\n\nLet's list the combinations:\n\n1. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 4 (invalid as 4 is repeated)\n2. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 3 (invalid as 3 is repeated)\n3. 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 2 (invalid as 2 is repeated)\n4. 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 1 (invalid as 1 is repeated)\n5. 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 0 (invalid as 0 is not a natural number)\n\nWe can see that we are not able to find valid combinations by this method because we are limited by the small numbers we must include. We need to find a new approach that allows for larger numbers to be included in the sum.\n\nLet's try starting with the largest number that could be included, which is 19 (since 1+2+3+4+5+6+19 = 40, which is too large, but 1+2+3+4+5+6+18 = 39, which is also too large, and so on until we get to 1+2+3+4+5+6+13 = 34, which is still too large, but 1+2+3+4+5+6+12 = 33, which allows us to replace the 6 with a 7 to get a sum of 25).\n\nSo, one valid combination is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 12. Now we can try to find more combinations by reducing the largest number and adjusting the others accordingly.\n\nHere are the combinations:\n\n1. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 3 (invalid as 3 is repeated)\n2. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 2 (invalid as 2 is repeated)\n3. 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 1 (invalid as 1 is repeated)\n4. 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 0 (invalid as 0 is not a natural number)\n\nWe can see that we are not able to find valid combinations by this method because we are limited by the small numbers we must include.

Now we can try to find more combinations by reducing the largest number and adjusting the others accordingly.\n\nHere are the combinations:\n\n1. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 4 (invalid as 4 is repeated)\n2. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 3 (invalid as 3 is repeated)\n3. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 2 (invalid as 2 is repeated)\n4. 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 1 (invalid as 1 is repeated)\n5. 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 0 (invalid as 0 is not a natural number)\n\nWe can see that we are not able to find valid combinations by this method because we are limited by the small numbers we must include.

Let's define our variables and plan our approach.\n\n**Variables:**\n- Total sum: 25\n- Number of different natural numbers: 7\n- Natural numbers: 1, 2, 3, ..., 24, 25 (since 25 is the limit)\n\n**Plan:**\n1. We will start by listing the smallest possible natural numbers and then increase them one by one while ensuring they are different and their sum is 25.\n2. We will ensure that the sum of the 7 numbers does not exceed 25 and that all numbers are unique.\n3. We will list all possible combinations.\n\n**Calculation:**\nLet's start with the smallest 7 different natural numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. Their sum is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7 = 28, which is already greater than 25, so we need to adjust our approach.\n\nSince 28 is too high, we need to reduce the sum by 3 to make it 25. We can do this by adjusting the largest number in our sequence. Instead of 7, we can use 4 (since 1, 2, and 3 are already in use), which gives us the sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 4. However, we need all numbers to be different, so we must adjust the sequence further.\n\nLet's try another approach by starting with the number 1 and finding the next possible smallest numbers that add up to 25:\n\n1. Start with 1, then add the next smallest numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 4 (as before, but we need to adjust the 4).\n2. Adjust the sequence to ensure all numbers are different and the sum is 25.\n\nWe can see that finding the combinations manually can be quite complex, so let's try a systematic approach:\n\n1. The smallest sum of 7 different natural numbers is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7 = 28. Since we need a sum of 25, we must replace one of these numbers with a smaller number that is not already in the list. The only way to do this is to replace the 7 with a 4, which is not allowed since 4 is already in the list.\n2. Since we cannot have 7 in our list, the next smallest sum of 6 different natural numbers is 1+2+3+4+5+6 = 21. We now have 4 remaining to reach 25, and we can add it as the 7th number since it's not in the list yet.\n3. Now we have the combination 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 4. To find more combinations, we can increase the last number step by step and decrease one of the other numbers to keep the sum at 25.\n\nLet's list the combinations:\n\n1. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 4 (invalid as 4 is repeated)\n2. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 3 (invalid as 3 is repeated)\n3. 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 2 (invalid as 2 is repeated)\n4. 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 1 (invalid as 1 is repeated)\n5. 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 0 (invalid as 0 is not a natural number)\n\nWe can see that we are not able to find valid combinations by this method because we are limited by the small numbers we must include. We need to find a new approach that allows for larger numbers to be included in the sum.\n\nLet's try starting with the largest number that could be included, which is 19 (since 1+2+3+4+5+6+19 = 40, which is too large, but 1+2+3+4+5+6+18 = 39, which is also too large, and so on until we get to 1+2+3+4+5+6+13 = 34, which is still too large, but 1+2+3+4+5+6+12 = 33, which allows us to replace the 6 with a 7 to get a sum of 25).\n\nSo, one valid combination is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 12. Now we can try to find more combinations by reducing the largest number and adjusting the others accordingly.\n\nHere are the combinations:\n\n1. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 3 (invalid as 3 is repeated)\n2. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 2 (invalid as 2 is repeated)\n3. 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 1 (invalid as 1 is repeated)\n4. 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 0 (invalid as 0 is not a natural number)\n\nWe can see that we are not able to find valid combinations by this method because we are limited by the small numbers we must include.

When the thousands digit is 5, we must be careful with the hundreds digit. It can only be 0 or 1 to not exceed 5120, but since 0 is not an option, it can only be 1 (1 possibility). The tens and units digits can then be any of the remaining 4 and then 3 digits, respectively.\n\nNow we calculate the number of possibilities for each segment:\n\n1. For 3xxx: 1 (for the thousands place) * 4 (for the hundreds place) * 4 (for the tens place) * 3 (for the units place) = 1 * 4 * 4 * 3 = 48\n2. For 4xxx: 1 * 5 * 4 * 3 = 60\n3. For 5xxx: 1 * 1 * 4 * 3 = 12\n\n**Answer:**\nTotal number of possible numbers = 48 + 60 + 12 = 120\n\nFinal answer: 120"]}
