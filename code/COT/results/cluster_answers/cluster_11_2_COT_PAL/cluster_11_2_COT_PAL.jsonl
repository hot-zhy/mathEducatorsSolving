Otherwise, the player loses €1. Let's calculate the probability of the sum of the two dice being greater than 10. Since the maximum sum of two dice is 12, the only possibilities for a sum greater than 10 are 11 and 12. There are only 3 combinations that yield a sum of 11 or 12: (5, 6), (6, 5), and (6, 6). Since there are 36 total possible outcomes when rolling two dice (6 faces on each die), the probability of the sum being greater than 10 is 3/36 or 1/12. Therefore, the probability of the sum not being greater than 10 is 1 - 1/12, which is 11/12.\n\nTo calculate the expected value of the amount of money the player loses in one game, we multiply the respective probabilities by their associated payouts. The player wins €9 with a probability of 1/12 and loses €1 with a probability of 11/12. Thus, the expected value can be calculated as follows:\n\nExpected Value = (Payout1 * Probability1) + (Payout2 * Probability2)\n\nExpected Value = (9 * 1/12) + (-1 * 11/12)\n\nSimplifying, we have:\n\nExpected Value = (9/12) - (11/12)\n\nExpected Value = -2/12\n\nExpected Value = -1/6\n\nTherefore, in one game, the player can expect to lose €1/6 on average.\n\nTo calculate the expected value of the amount of money the player loses in 60 games, we multiply the expected value of one game by the number of games played:\n\nExpected Value of 60 games = (-1/6) * 60\n\nExpected Value of 60 games = -10\n\nHence, the player can expect to lose €10 when playing 60 games.\n\nAnswer: 10"]}

Calculate the number of people per table: Since 12 people can sit around a square table, there are 3 people on each side of the square table.\n2. Determine the seating for the long table: When 8 square tables are put together in a row, the two people at the ends of each inner side will be replaced by one person at the end of the long table.\n3. Calculate the total seating: Each square table loses 2 seating spots when combined (except for the first and last table), so the total loss is 2 spots * (8 tables - 2) = 12 spots.\n4. Subtract the lost spots from the total: 12 people per table * 8 tables = 96 people, then subtract the lost spots: 96 - 12 = 84 people.\n5. Add the people at the two ends of the long table: 84 + 2 = 86 people.\n\nAnswer: 86"]}
