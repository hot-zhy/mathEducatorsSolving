For 4 ◈ 7 = 21, we can try to find a relationship between the numbers 4, 7, and 21.\n2. For 6 ◈ 22 = 20, we look for a relationship between 6, 22, and 20.\n3. For 8 ◈ 30 = 26, we look for a relationship between 8, 30, and 26.\n\nLooking at the examples, one possible pattern is that the result of \"◈\" is the product of the two numbers minus the first number:\n\n1. 4 ◈ 7 = (4 * 7) - 4 = 28 - 4 = 24 (which does not match the given 21, so we need to adjust our pattern)\n2. 6 ◈ 22 = (6 * 22) - 6 = 132 - 6 = 126 (which does not match the given 20, so we need to adjust our pattern)\n3. 8 ◈ 30 = (8 * 30) - 8 = 240 - 8 = 232 (which does not match the given 26, so we need to adjust our pattern)\n\nThe pattern does not seem to be consistent with multiplication and subtraction alone.
