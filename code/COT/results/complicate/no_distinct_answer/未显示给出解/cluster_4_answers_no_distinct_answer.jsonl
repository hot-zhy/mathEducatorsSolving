Understanding the Equations: We have three equations given by 31 + a = 26 + b = 20 + c, where a, b, and c are prime numbers.\n\n2. Equating the Expressions: Since 31 + a = 26 + b, we can find a in terms of b by rearranging the equation: a = b - 5.\n\n3. Similarly, since 26 + b = 20 + c, we can find b in terms of c by rearranging the equation: b = c + 6.\n\n4. Substituting b into the equation for a: a = (c + 6) - 5 = c + 1.\n\n5. Now we have expressions for a and b in terms of c: a = c + 1 and b = c + 6.\n\n6. Since a, b, and c are all prime numbers, we need to find a prime number c such that c + 1 and c + 6 are also prime.
