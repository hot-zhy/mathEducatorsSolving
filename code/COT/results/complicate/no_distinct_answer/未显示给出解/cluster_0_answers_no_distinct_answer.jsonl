In this case, the last digit is already 5, so the number satisfies the divisibility rule for 5.\n\nThe divisibility rule for 9 states that the sum of all the digits must be a multiple of 9. Let's denote the missing digit as 'X'. The sum of the given digits is:\n6 + 3 + X + 2 + 5 = 16 + X\n\nFor the number to be divisible by 9, the sum of the digits must be a multiple of 9. The closest multiples of 9 to 16 are 9 and 18. Since 16 is already greater than 9, we need to find the next multiple of 9, which is 18. However, 16 + X cannot equal 18 because that would mean X is 2, and we need a sum that is greater than 16.\n\nThe next multiple of 9 after 18 is 27. To find the value of X that makes the sum 27, we set up the equation:\n16 + X = 27\nX = 27 - 16\nX = 11\n\nHowever, X must be a single digit, and 11 is not a single digit. Therefore, we need to look at the next multiple of 9, which is 36.\n\nSetting up the equation:\n16 + X = 36\nX = 36 - 16\nX = 20\n\nAgain, X must be a single digit, so we continue to the next multiple of 9, which is 45.\n\nSetting up the equation:\n16 + X = 45\nX = 45 - 16\nX = 29\n\nOnce more, X must be a single digit, so we continue to the next multiple of 9, which is 54.\n\nSetting up the equation:\n16 + X = 54\nX = 54 - 16\nX = 38\n\nContinuing this process, we look for the next multiple of 9 that, when subtracted by 16, gives us a single-digit number.\n\nThe next multiple of 9 is 63:\n16 + X = 63\nX = 63 -

This gives us:\n\n1ATH + HTA1 = 12221\n\nNow, looking at the units place, we have H + 1 = 1 or H + 1 = 11 (if there is a carry from the tens place). Since H is a digit, the only possibility is H = 0. But H cannot be 0 because then HTAM would not be a four-digit number. Therefore, there must be a carry from the tens place, and H = 0 + 10 - 1 = 9.\n\nNow we have:\n\n1AT9 + 9TA1 = 12221\n\nLooking at the tens place, we have T + 9 = 2 or T + 9 = 12 (with a carry from the hundreds place).

Since A + 3 = 12, we get A = 9. But A cannot be 9 because H is already 9 and the digits must be different. Therefore, we made a mistake; there must be a carry from the addition of T and 9, which we initially ignored.\n\nLet's correct this. If T + 9 results in a carry, then T + 9 = 22, which means T = 3 and there is a carry into the hundreds place. This carry into the hundreds place means A + 3 + 1 (carry) = 12, so A = 8.\n\nNow we have:\n\n1839 + 9381 = 12220\n\nAdding these numbers, we get the correct sum of 12220, which is 1 less than 12221.

But H is already at its maximum value of 9, so we need to reconsider our previous steps.\n\nLet's go back and check our work. We assumed that T + 9 resulted in a carry, but we didn't consider that the carry from the tens place could affect this. If T + 9 + 1 (carry from tens place) = 22, then T = 2.\n\nNow we have:\n\n1A29 + 92A1 = 12221\n\nLooking at the hundreds place again, A + 2 + 1 (carry from tens place) must equal 12 or 2. Since A cannot be 9 (as H is 9), we must have a carry from the thousands place, so A + 2 + 1 = 12, which means A = 9.\n\nNow we have:\n\n1929 + 9291 = 12220\n\nThis still gives us a sum of 12220, which is 1 less than 12221.

The last digit of HTAM is M, which is 1, so the first digit of MATH must also be 1. This means that the second digit of HTAM is A, and the second-to-last digit of MATH is also A. Similarly, the third digit of HTAM is T, and the third digit of MATH is also T. Finally, the first digit of HTAM is H, and the last digit of MATH is also H.\n\nSince the sum of MATH and HTAM is 12221, the last digit of the sum (the units place) must be the sum of H and 1. Since this digit is 1, H must be 0, which we previously determined is not possible because HTAM would not be a four-digit number.

Since A cannot be 9 (as H is 9), we must have a carry from the thousands place, so A + 2 + 1 = 12, which means A = 9.\n\nNow we have:\n\n1929 + 9291 = 12220\n\nThis still gives us a sum of 12220, which is 1 less than 12221. We need to account for this difference by adding 1 to the thousands place, which we can do by increasing M from 1 to 2. However, M is already set to 1, and increasing it would violate the condition of MATH being a four-digit number.\n\nWe seem to have reached an impasse with our current approach, so let's try a different strategy. Since we know that MATH + HTAM = 12221 and M must be 1, let's look at the possible values for A, T, and H that would allow the sum to be a palindrome (the same forwards and backwards), as 12221 is.\n\nIf M = 1, then HTAM is a palindrome of MATH. The last digit of HTAM is M, which is 1, so the first digit of MATH must also be 1. This means that the second digit of HTAM is A, and the second-to-last digit of MATH is also A. Similarly, the third digit of HTAM is T, and the third digit of MATH is also T. Finally, the first digit of HTAM is H, and the last digit of MATH is also H.\n\nSince the sum of MATH and HTAM is 12221, the last digit of the sum (the units place) must be the sum of H and 1. Since this digit is 1, H must be 0, which we previously determined is not possible because HTAM would not be a four-digit number. Therefore, there must be a carry from the tens place to the units place, making the sum of H and 1 equal to 11. This means H = 0 + 10 - 1 = 9.\n\nNow we have:\n\n1AT9 + 9TA1 = 12221\n\nThe tens place of the sum is 2, which is the sum of T and 9 plus the carry from the units place. Since we have a carry from the units place, T + 9 must equal 11 or 21. Since T is a digit, T + 9 = 11, which means T = 2.\n\nNow we have:\n\n1A29 + 92A1 = 12221\n\nThe hundreds place of the sum is 2, which is the sum of A and 2 plus the carry from the tens place.
