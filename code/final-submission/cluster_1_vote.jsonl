We need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 60 and 90 seconds that is also a multiple of 30 seconds.\n\nThe LCM of 60 and 90 is 180 seconds (which is 3 minutes), as both 60 and 90 are divisible by 180. Since 180 seconds is also a multiple of 30 seconds, it satisfies the condition for the third traffic light.\n\nHowever, we need to check if this LCM falls within the 9-minute window. Since 180 seconds is 3 minutes, and 9 minutes is 540 seconds, 180 seconds is within the 9-minute window.\n\nTherefore, the shortest time the third traffic light has to change by is 180 seconds or 3 minutes.\n\nAnswer: 3"]}
